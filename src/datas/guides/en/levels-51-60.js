    detailsHtml: `<h2>Level Overview</h2>
  <p>Level 51 of Cookingdom introduces players to the rich and filling American Breakfast set. Expect multiple items per order and a need for tight multitasking. This level tests your speed and attention to detail.</p>
  
  <h2>American Breakfast Components</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pancakes:</strong> Cook on the griddle and serve with butter or syrup.</li>
    <li><strong>Scrambled Eggs:</strong> Quick to cook, but require attention to prevent overcooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Bacon:</strong> Sizzles on the grill. Time-sensitive.</li>
    <li><strong>Toast:</strong> Use the toaster, then apply butter or jam as requested.</li>
    <li><strong>Coffee:</strong> Serve fresh and hot. Refill the pot when low.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Step-by-Step Strategy</h2>
  <h3>1. Start with the Griddle</h3>
  <p>Place bacon and pancakes on the griddle first since they take the longest. Always keep an eye on them to avoid burning.</p>
  
  <h3>2. Prepare Eggs and Toast</h3>
  <p>As the griddle items cook, start scrambling eggs and placing bread in the toaster. Eggs cook quickly and can overcook easily.</p>
  
  <h3>3. Assemble Orders Quickly</h3>
  <p>Combine pancakes, eggs, bacon, toast, and coffee as per the customer’s order. Each plate may have a different variation, so check the request carefully.</p>
  
  <h3>4. Serve Immediately</h3>
  <p>Timing is key. Serve as soon as an order is complete to maintain high customer satisfaction.</p>
  
  <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Preheat and Prep:</strong> Keep bacon and pancakes going in rotation. Don’t wait for orders to start cooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Watch the Toaster:</strong> Toast can burn quickly. Grab it immediately when ready.</li>
    <li><strong>Queue Coffee:</strong> Always have coffee ready. Refill as soon as it’s half empty.</li>
    <li><strong>Multitask:</strong> While something cooks, prep another item or clear dishes to save time.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Visual Cues:</strong> Watch food color and animation to judge doneness. Trust your timing rhythm.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Level 51 elevates your Cookingdom experience by requiring you to juggle multiple breakfast items per customer. Perfect your rhythm and timing to get all components cooked just right. Efficient multitasking and sharp focus will earn you top rewards and unlock even more complex kitchens in future levels.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Prepare and serve the correct Beans Sweet Soup combinations to all customers before the timer ends. Focus on accuracy, timing, and topping placement.</p>

<h2>Cooking Process</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Boil the Beans</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Select the pot and tap to start boiling red or mung beans as shown in the order.</li>
  <li>Wait for the progress bar to fill up. Don’t overboil or the soup will become mushy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Add Syrup</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Once boiled, add a ladle of sweet syrup to the beans.</li>
  <li>The right amount is indicated visually—overpouring may lead to a lower satisfaction score.</li>

  <li>Drag and drop the correct toppings based on customer request. Topping order may matter for certain VIP customers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 4: Serve</h3>
<p>Once completed, serve the sweet soup to the corresponding customer quickly. Delays or incorrect toppings will impact your rating.</p>

<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Memorize Topping Combos:</strong> Common combinations repeat across orders. Remembering them speeds up your workflow.</li>
  <li><strong>Time Boiling Carefully:</strong> Start boiling the next batch while finishing toppings on the current bowl to multitask.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t Overpour Syrup:</strong> Watch the visual syrup level marker and stop at the right moment.</li>
  <li><strong>Tap Sequence Efficiency:</strong> Develop a habit of tapping in the same order: boil → syrup → toppings → serve.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Visual Cues:</strong> Pay attention to icon highlights and sound prompts to guide your timing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Level 52 tests your timing and multitasking as you prepare Beans Sweet Soup with various topping requests. Success requires accurate portioning, boiling discipline, and customer-focused speed. Master this level to unlock further Asian dessert recipes and boost your dessert kitchen upgrades.</p>

  <p>In Level 53 of Cookingdom, players face the bustling city crowd with a craving for ice cream! Your task is to scoop, top, and serve colorful ice cream cones with speed and accuracy.</p>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Strategy</h2>
  <h3>1. Take the Cone</h3>
  <p>Grab a cone and place it in the holding stand. You can prep more than one at a time during rush periods.</p>
  
  <h3>2. Add Scoops</h3>
  <p>Follow the order’s flavor sequence exactly—some customers request single scoops, others want triple-scoop towers.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tap the flavor machine in the right order (e.g., chocolate → vanilla → mint).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>3. Apply Toppings</h3>
  <p>After scooping, apply requested toppings. Use precision: the wrong topping lowers satisfaction.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Examples: Chocolate syrup on mint, rainbow sprinkles on strawberry, or a cherry on top.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>4. Serve Immediately</h3>
  <p>Once completed, serve the cone quickly before it melts or the customer loses patience.</p>
  
  <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Memorize Scoop Orders:</strong> Practice recognizing common scoop patterns to speed up builds.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-place Cones:</strong> Always have cones ready during high-traffic waves.</li>
    <li><strong>Be Precise:</strong> Wrong scoops or toppings = lost stars. Accuracy is more valuable than speed in this level.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Let It Melt:</strong> A melting cone leads to a failed order. Focus on timely delivery.</li>
    <li><strong>Upgrade Machines:</strong> Faster flavor dispensers and auto-toppers reduce mistakes and increase profit.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Level 53’s urban ice cream stand challenges your speed, accuracy, and multitasking. The colorful visuals and demand for precision make this a fun and dynamic level. Serve up sweet success by balancing prep, topping, and delivery. Succeed to earn bonus gems and unlock more dessert-themed tools for future levels!</p>`,

  <h2>Ingredients Needed</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rice Base:</strong> The primary component; must be boiled to fluffy perfection.</li>
    <li><strong>Cardoon Vegetable:</strong> Sliced and sautéed until tender.</li>

  <h2>Cooking Process</h2>

  <p>Place rice in a pot with broth. Stir occasionally to avoid burning. This takes the longest, so start early.</p>
  
  <h3>2. Prepare Cardoons</h3>
  <p>Sauté sliced cardoons in a skillet with olive oil. Keep an eye out—they burn quickly if left unattended.</p>
  
  <h3>3. Add Proteins (If Required)</h3>
  <p>For meat orders, cook chorizo or chicken on a separate pan. Add to the rice when both are ready.</p>
  
  <h3>4. Plate and Serve</h3>
  <p>Combine rice, cardoons, and optional proteins onto a serving plate. Garnish if requested (e.g., lemon wedge or herbs). Deliver promptly!</p>

    <li><strong>Stagger Cardoon Prep:</strong> Too many at once can overwhelm your stove. Cook in batches if needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Watch for Burn Warnings:</strong> Burnt rice or overcooked veggies drastically lower scores.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Idle Time:</strong> While rice simmers, prep toppings or clean utensils.</li>
    <li><strong>Upgrade Stove:</strong> Faster cooking helps with complex recipes like Arroz Cardo.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Level 55 introduces the vibrant flavors of the Caribbean with Jamaican Pineapple Jerk Chicken. This level focuses on precise grilling, marinade preparation, and fast plating.</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chicken Thighs:</strong> The core protein; needs to be marinated and grilled.</li>
    <li><strong>Jerk Marinade:</strong> A spicy-sweet sauce with Scotch bonnet peppers, allspice, garlic, and thyme.</li>
    <li><strong>Pineapple Slices:</strong> Grilled to caramelized perfection and served on the side.</li>
    <li><strong>Optional Sides:</strong> Rice & peas or fried plantains may be requested by some customers.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Cooking Process</h2>
  <h3>1. Marinate the Chicken</h3>
  <p>Coat the chicken in jerk marinade and let it rest briefly. Marination gives flavor depth and spice.</p>
  
  <h3>2. Grill the Chicken</h3>
  <p>Place the marinated chicken on the grill. Watch it closely—jerk sauce can burn due to its sugar content. Flip once for even cooking.</p>
  
  <h3>3. Grill the Pineapple</h3>
  <p>Add pineapple slices to the grill. Aim for golden-brown grill marks and a juicy finish. Do not overcook or they’ll dry out.</p>
  
  <h3>4. Prepare Optional Sides</h3>
  <p>Some customers will request sides like rice or fried plantains. Prepare and plate them quickly to avoid delays.</p>
  
  <h3>5. Plate and Serve</h3>
  <p>Arrange the jerk chicken with pineapple and any sides. Garnish with green onions or lime wedges if prompted. Serve hot!</p>
  
  <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Watch the Grill:</strong> Both chicken and pineapple can burn fast. Don’t leave the grill unattended.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-marinate Multiple Batches:</strong> If space allows, marinate extra chicken to speed up service.</li>
    <li><strong>Grill in Parallel:</strong> Cook chicken and pineapple at the same time to maximize efficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>Upgrade Grill Station:</strong> Larger/faster grills make a big difference in this level.</li>
    <li><strong>Side Prep Timing:</strong> Start rice or plantains while the main protein is grilling.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Level 55 turns up the heat with bold Caribbean flavor. Balancing spice, grill timing, and side dish management is key to success. Mastering this dish will bring new rewards, unlock special ingredients, and prepare you for even more complex international recipes.</p>`,

<p>Successfully prepare and serve multiple orders of Pelmeni. Efficiency in both preparation and boiling is required to achieve a high score. Accuracy and speed are rewarded.</p>

<h2>Pelmeni Making Process</h2>
<h3>Prepare Dough and Filling:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dough:</strong> Select dough from the ingredient tray and roll it out into thin circles.</li>
  <li><strong>Filling:</strong> Scoop the ground meat mixture into the center of each dough circle.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shape the Dumplings:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fold the dough in half and seal the edges tightly to form the classic Pelmeni shape.</li>
  <li>Ensure no filling leaks out — this affects cooking and presentation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Boil the Pelmeni:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Place shaped Pelmeni into boiling water.</li>
  <li><strong>Watch the timer:</strong> Proper boiling time is key — undercooked dumplings are chewy, overcooked ones fall apart.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Serve the Pelmeni:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When perfectly cooked, remove and plate the Pelmeni.</li>
  <li>Add garnishes such as sour cream or herbs, if requested.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately to the correct customer to avoid penalties.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Multitask:</strong> While one batch is boiling, prepare another to avoid downtime.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep Boiling Stations Busy:</strong> You may have two boiling pots — utilize both to keep pace with orders.</li>
  <li><strong>Precision:</strong> Always seal dumplings properly to prevent breaking in water.</li>
  <li><strong>Customer Preferences:</strong> Some may request extra garnishes — pay attention to order bubbles.</li>
  <li><strong>Ingredient Stock:</strong> Refill dough and meat trays between batches to stay ahead.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Level 56 of Cookingdom is a test of your cooking speed, accuracy, and multitasking skills. Making Pelmeni involves multiple stages — dough, filling, shaping, boiling, and serving — all under time pressure. Mastering this level unlocks new Eastern European recipes and advanced boiling tools. Serve your customers efficiently and earn maximum stars!</p>`,

<p>Level 58 challenges players to create the elegant and airy dessert known as <strong>Pavlova</strong>. This level introduces precision baking and delicate ingredient handling, with a focus on timing, presentation, and accuracy. You'll need to whip the perfect meringue, bake it just right, and top it with fruits and cream.</p>

<h2>Level 58 Goal</h2>
<p>Create and serve beautifully decorated Pavlovas to several customers. Pay attention to meringue doneness and topping combinations to achieve high scores.</p>

<h2>Pavlova Making Process</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Meringue Base</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Egg Whites:</strong> Start by whisking egg whites in the mixer until they form soft peaks.</li>
  <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Gradually add sugar to stabilize the meringue and make it glossy.</li>
  <li><strong>Whip to Stiff Peaks:</strong> Continue mixing until stiff peaks form — do not overmix!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Bake the Meringue</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Transfer the meringue onto a baking tray.</li>
  <li>Bake at a low temperature — timing is crucial for a crisp exterior and soft center.</li>
  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Avoid opening the oven door too often to maintain stable temperature.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Add Whipped Cream and Fruits</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Once cooled, spread a layer of whipped cream over the Pavlova base.</li>
  <li>Top with fresh fruits such as strawberries, kiwi, blueberries, or passion fruit as requested.</li>
  <li>Presentation matters! Neatly arrange the fruits for bonus points.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 4: Serve</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Quickly serve the finished dessert before the cream melts or the meringue softens.</li>
  <li>Each customer may have a different fruit preference or presentation request.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Watch the Mixer:</strong> Over-whipping leads to grainy meringue. Stop at stiff, glossy peaks.</li>
  <li><strong>Perfect Baking Time:</strong> Pavlova is sensitive — slightly underbaked is better than burnt.</li>
  <li><strong>Top Just Before Serving:</strong> Adding cream too early causes sogginess. Time it right.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Fruit Efficiently:</strong> Don’t waste time switching between ingredients — plan topping sequences.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus on Presentation:</strong> Beautiful plating gives you extra points and happy customers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Cookingdom Level 58 offers a delightful challenge for dessert lovers. Mastering the Pavlova means balancing precision, speed, and artistry. With its light meringue base, sweet cream, and colorful fruits, this dish tests your attention to detail and baking skill. Complete the level to unlock premium desserts and gain high-tier kitchen upgrades!</p>`,
