          <h2>Level Overview</h2>
          <p>Cookingdom Level 91 challenges players to prepare <strong>Sticky Rice with Lotus Seeds</strong>, a classic dessert dish that tests timing, precision, and balance of flavors. The goal is to achieve rice that is soft yet not mushy, while the lotus seeds must be tender with a natural sweetness. Overcooking or under-seasoning will cost points, so accuracy is essential.</p>
