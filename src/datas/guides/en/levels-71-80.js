          <h2>Level Overview</h2>
        
          <p>Welcome to Level 71, where you'll dive into the fresh and vibrant world of Nicoise Salad! This level challenges you to assemble a traditional Nicoise Salad with a focus on fresh ingredients, timing, and accuracy. Create the perfect balance of flavors to satisfy your customers’ needs.</p>
        
          <h2>Objective</h2>
        
          <p>Build a Nicoise Salad by combining a variety of fresh ingredients in the correct order. Match customer preferences while ensuring that the salad's presentation is as beautiful as it is tasty.</p>
        
          <h2>Assembly Process</h2>
        
          <h3>Step 1: Select the Base Greens</h3>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Start with a bed of mixed greens or lettuce. Make sure the portion size is correct for the customer’s order.</li>
            <li>If requested, add a drizzle of olive oil or vinaigrette as the base dressing.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h3>Step 2: Add the Proteins</h3>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Choose from tuna, hard-boiled eggs, or grilled chicken to add the necessary protein.</li>
            <li>Portion each protein according to customer preference (e.g., double tuna or egg). Ensure each ingredient is neatly arranged.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h3>Step 3: Add Vegetables</h3>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Layer on fresh tomatoes, green beans, olives, and thinly sliced radishes. Arrange them artfully for a beautiful presentation.</li>
            <li>Some guests may request extra veggies or specific preferences (e.g., no olives, extra tomatoes), so check the order carefully.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h3>Step 4: Dress and Garnish</h3>
        
          <p>Finish the salad with a generous serving of anchovy vinaigrette or a simple lemon dressing. Garnish with a few sprigs of parsley or basil for that extra touch of flavor and elegance.</p>
        
          <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
        
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Layer the Ingredients:</strong> Keep a beautiful presentation by layering the ingredients carefully, placing proteins in the center and vegetables around them.</li>
            <li><strong>Memorize Common Orders:</strong> Many customers prefer the traditional Nicoise salad, so memorize the combination of tuna, egg, and veggies for faster assembly.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> The key to a perfect Nicoise Salad is freshness—ensure that all vegetables and proteins are fresh to create the best flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep Everything Neat:</strong> Since the presentation is important, be mindful of arranging each component neatly for an appealing look.</li>
            <li><strong>Double-Check Special Orders:</strong> Some customers may request variations, such as gluten-free or dairy-free options, so make sure to check for any notes or icons on their order tickets.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h2>Summary</h2>
        
          <p>Cookingdom Level 71 challenges you to perfect the art of assembling a Nicoise Salad with precision and flair. By balancing flavors and maintaining a clean, elegant presentation, you’ll earn 3 stars and unlock new ingredients like anchovy vinaigrette and roasted potatoes.</p>

          <h2>Level Overview</h2>
        
          <p>Welcome to Level 72, where you’ll dive into the art of making momos—delicious steamed dumplings! This level challenges you to master the delicate process of filling, folding, and steaming momos. Accuracy and speed are essential to satisfy your customers’ orders.</p>
        
          <h2>Objective</h2>
        
          <p>Craft perfect momos by combining a variety of fillings and wrapping them neatly. Ensure the steam time is perfect, and serve the momos at the right temperature to impress your customers.</p>
        
          <h2>Assembly Process</h2>
        
          <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Start by rolling out the dough to the perfect thickness—thin but not too fragile.</li>
            <li>If the dough is too thick, it will be chewy; if too thin, it might tear during steaming.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h3>Step 2: Add the Filling</h3>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Choose the filling: classic chicken, vegetarian (mushrooms, cabbage, and carrots), or pork.</li>
            <li>Place the filling in the center of the dough circle. Don’t overfill; leave enough space for sealing.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h3>Step 3: Fold and Seal</h3>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Carefully fold the dough into a half-moon shape. Pinch the edges tightly to avoid leakage during steaming.</li>
            <li>For extra flair, create a pleated design along the edge.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h3>Step 4: Steam and Serve</h3>
        
          <p>Place the momos into the steamer and cook them for the perfect amount of time—around 5 minutes. Once they’re done, serve them hot and fresh with a side of dipping sauce.</p>
        
          <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
        
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Perfect Your Fold:</strong> The way you fold your momo is crucial for presentation and sealing the filling. Take your time to get a neat fold.</li>
            <li><strong>Fillings Matter:</strong> Balance the flavor and texture of your filling. Avoid making it too wet, as it can make the dough soggy.</li>
            <li><strong>Steam Carefully:</strong> Keep the steamer lid tightly closed to maintain consistent heat, and make sure the water level is just right for steaming.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Quick with Orders:</strong> Some customers may want a specific type of momo or extra spice. Keep an eye on special requests and act fast.</li>
            <li><strong>Check the Steaming Time:</strong> Over-steaming will make the dough too soft, while under-steaming will leave it doughy. Aim for a perfect balance.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h2>Summary</h2>
        
          <p>Cookingdom Level 72 takes you into the world of delicate and delicious momos. By mastering the steps of dough preparation, filling selection, folding technique, and perfect steaming time, you can earn 3 stars and unlock exciting new fillings for your next challenges.</p>

          <h2>Level Overview</h2>
        
          <p>Welcome to Level 73, where you will be crafting the delightful Turkish flatbread, Gozleme! In this level, you’ll learn to prepare Gozleme with various fillings, ensuring they are folded, grilled, and served perfectly to satisfy your customers’ cravings.</p>
        
          <h2>Objective</h2>
        
          <p>Your goal is to create perfect Gozleme by preparing the dough, adding the right filling, and grilling them to a crispy finish. The key is to balance filling and grilling time to ensure a perfect dish every time.</p>
        
          <h2>Assembly Process</h2>
        
          <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Roll out the dough thinly to create a soft yet sturdy base for the Gozleme.</li>
            <li>The dough should be thin enough to fold but not too delicate. Aim for a smooth, round shape to prevent tearing during grilling.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h3>Step 2: Add the Filling</h3>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Select your fillings from a variety of options: spinach and feta, minced lamb, or cheese and herbs.</li>
            <li>Spread the filling evenly across the dough, but don’t overfill—leave room to fold the edges over.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h3>Step 3: Fold the Dough</h3>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Fold the dough over the filling, ensuring the edges meet to seal in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Press the edges down firmly to prevent any fillings from spilling out while grilling.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h3>Step 4: Grill the Gozleme</h3>
        
          <p>Place the folded Gozleme onto the grill, cooking each side until golden brown and crispy. Be careful not to burn the flatbread while making sure the filling is well-cooked and warm.</p>
        
          <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
        
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Perfect the Fold:</strong> The way you fold the dough is key to ensuring the Gozleme stays sealed and the filling doesn’t spill out during grilling.</li>
            <li><strong>Use the Right Filling Ratio:</strong> Too much filling will make it hard to fold and grill properly, while too little will make the Gozleme too dry. Find a good balance.</li>
            <li><strong>Grill at Medium Heat:</strong> Don’t overheat the grill, as high heat might burn the Gozleme before the filling is cooked. Grill at medium heat for best results.</li>
            <li><strong>Watch for Special Requests:</strong> Some customers may request extra cheese, spicy fillings, or other customizations—keep an eye on their orders.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve Hot:</strong> Gozleme should be served immediately after grilling while they’re still hot and crispy.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h2>Summary</h2>
        
          <p>Cookingdom Level 73 teaches you the art of making delicious, crispy Gozleme. By mastering the dough preparation, perfecting the folding technique, and grilling at the right temperature, you’ll be able to earn 3 stars and unlock new fillings for your future Gozleme creations.</p>

          <p>Welcome to Level 74, where you’ll be preparing a delicious and delicate Grilled Winter Fish! This level teaches you how to grill fish to perfection, balancing seasoning, grilling time, and presentation to create a dish that will satisfy your customers’ taste buds.</p>
        
          <h2>Objective</h2>
        
          <p>Your goal is to grill Winter Fish to the right level of doneness, ensuring the flavors are enhanced with the right seasonings and garnishes. Plate the fish beautifully and serve it hot for the best results.</p>
        
          <h2>Assembly Process</h2>
        
          <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Fish</h3>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Select a fresh Winter Fish fillet. Ensure the fish is thawed if it was frozen, and remove any bones or scales.</li>
            <li>Season the fish with a touch of olive oil, salt, pepper, and a dash of lemon juice for a light, flavorful base.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h3>Step 2: Preheat the Grill</h3>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Heat the grill to medium-high. A well-heated grill will ensure the fish cooks evenly and develops a beautiful sear.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil the grill grates to prevent the fish from sticking.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h3>Step 3: Grill the Fish</h3>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Place the fish on the grill, skin-side down (if applicable), and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side, depending on thickness.</li>
            <li>Flip the fish gently to avoid breaking it. Grill until the fish flakes easily with a fork and is opaque throughout.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h3>Step 4: Garnish and Serve</h3>
        
          <p>Once the fish is perfectly grilled, plate it and garnish with fresh herbs, a drizzle of citrus glaze (if available), and a side of vegetables or a light salad for a complete dish.</p>
        
          <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
        
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> The fish should flake easily and be opaque throughout. Avoid overcooking it, as it can become dry.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Fresh Fish:</strong> Fresh, high-quality fish will yield the best flavor. If possible, use locally sourced or sustainable fish.</li>
            <li><strong>Grill Marks:</strong> To get beautiful grill marks, resist the urge to move the fish around too much. Let it cook on each side for the right amount of time.</li>
            <li><strong>Experiment with Seasonings:</strong> While a basic seasoning of salt and pepper works, you can experiment with herbs like thyme, dill, or rosemary for added flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Plating is Key:</strong> A well-plated dish is essential. Consider serving the grilled fish alongside some fresh greens or a tangy dressing to add color and contrast.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h2>Summary</h2>
        
          <p>Cookingdom Level 74 takes you into the world of grilling with the Grilled Winter Fish dish. By mastering the art of seasoning, grilling, and presenting the fish, you’ll be able to earn 3 stars and unlock a new citrus glaze to enhance future dishes.</p>

          <h2>Level Overview</h2>
        
          <p>Welcome to Level 75, where you'll create the perfect bowl of Udon noodles! In this level, you'll prepare the thick, chewy noodles and the savory broth that make Udon a beloved dish in Japanese cuisine. Your goal is to balance the noodles, broth, and toppings to deliver a delicious and authentic dish.</p>
        
          <h2>Objective</h2>
        
          <p>Your goal is to cook Udon noodles to the right texture, make the broth rich and flavorful, and combine everything to create the perfect Udon dish. Top it with the right garnishes for a satisfying customer experience.</p>
        
          <h2>Assembly Process</h2>
        
          <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Broth</h3>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Start by simmering the broth. Combine dashi, soy sauce, and mirin in a pot and bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Let the broth simmer for about 10 minutes to blend the flavors, and adjust seasoning as needed (salt, soy sauce, etc.).</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h3>Step 2: Cook the Udon Noodles</h3>
        
          <ul>
            <li>In a separate pot, bring water to a boil and cook the Udon noodles for about 5-7 minutes, or until they are tender but still chewy.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, drain the noodles and rinse them briefly in cold water to stop the cooking process and remove excess starch.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h3>Step 3: Combine Noodles and Broth</h3>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Place the cooked Udon noodles into a bowl and ladle the hot broth over the top. Ensure the noodles are well-coated with the savory broth.</li>
            <li>Make sure the broth is hot and ready before serving to keep the Udon noodles from becoming soggy.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h3>Step 4: Add Toppings</h3>
        
          <p>Top your Udon with traditional garnishes like sliced green onions, a boiled egg, tempura shrimp, or a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Adjust toppings to customer preferences, as some may prefer extra toppings or none at all.</p>
        
          <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
        
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Cook Noodles Just Right:</strong> Udon noodles should have a firm, chewy texture. Overcooking them will make them soft and soggy.</li>
            <li><strong>Simmer Broth Slowly:</strong> Let the broth simmer gently to extract all the flavors without boiling it too aggressively.</li>
            <li><strong>Personalize Toppings:</strong> Some customers might prefer extra toppings such as tempura or mushrooms. Check each order carefully for customization.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh ingredients, particularly for the broth, will significantly enhance the flavor. Use high-quality dashi and soy sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve Hot:</strong> Udon is best served hot, so ensure both the noodles and broth are at the perfect temperature before serving.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h2>Summary</h2>
        
          <p>Cookingdom Level 75 brings you the art of Udon, a classic Japanese noodle dish.
