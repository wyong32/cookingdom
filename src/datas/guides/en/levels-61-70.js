      <h2>Level Overview</h2>
      
      <p>Level 61 introduces the art of grilling with the Backyard Barbecue. You'll need to prepare various meats and vegetables, ensuring they’re grilled to perfection and served with the right sauces and sides.</p>
      
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      
      <p>Grill and serve various barbecue dishes to all customers within the time limit. Pay attention to grilling times and ensure that side dishes are prepared correctly to meet customer expectations.</p>
      
      <h2>Cooking Process</h2>
      
      <h3>Step 1: Select the Ingredients</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Start by selecting the meat or vegetables requested by the customer. Options include chicken, beef, sausages, and veggies like corn and bell peppers.</li>
        <li>Drag the selected ingredient onto the grill and start the cooking process.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 2: Grill the Meat or Veggies</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Watch the grill closely. Each item requires a specific grilling time—overcooked food will lose its flavor and lead to a low rating.</li>
        <li>Flip the ingredients as needed. Pay attention to the visual cues to determine when to flip or remove the item from the grill.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 3: Prepare Sides and Sauces</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>In addition to grilling, you will need to prepare sides such as baked potatoes, salads, and corn on the cob.</li>
        <li>Also, prepare the necessary sauces—barbecue sauce, ketchup, or spicy dip—according to the customer's order.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 4: Serve</h3>
      
      <p>Once everything is cooked and the sides and sauces are ready, serve the meal to the corresponding customer quickly. Delays or incorrect sides and sauces will result in a lower rating.</p>
      
      <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Timing is Key:</strong> Keep track of each ingredient’s cooking time to ensure everything is grilled to perfection.</li>
        <li><strong>Multitask Efficiently:</strong> While grilling one item, start preparing the sides or sauces to save time.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch for Visual Cues:</strong> The grill has visual indicators showing when food is cooked. Flip or remove items promptly based on these cues.</li>
        <li><strong>Memorize Sides and Sauces:</strong> Some customers request specific sides or sauces. Keep track of these to speed up your workflow.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep an Eye on Orders:</strong> Make sure you’re not missing any ingredients or sides requested by customers, as that will lead to lower ratings.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      
      <p>Level 61 challenges you to perfect your grilling skills, multitask with sides and sauces, and manage timing effectively to serve customers. Mastering the Backyard Barbecue will unlock new grill recipes and allow you to upgrade your barbecue station.</p>

      <h2>Level Overview</h2>
      
      <p>Level 62 introduces a hearty and slow-cooked dish: Campfire Beef Stew. This level focuses on managing the slow-cooking process and adding the right ingredients at the right time to create a flavorful stew.</p>
      
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      
      <p>Prepare the perfect Campfire Beef Stew for each customer by following the exact cooking sequence and using the proper ingredients to maximize satisfaction.</p>
      
      <h2>Cooking Process</h2>
      
      <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Start by selecting the beef and vegetables—carrots, potatoes, onions, and garlic—according to the customer’s order.</li>
        <li>Chop and prepare the ingredients, and get them ready for slow-cooking.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 2: Begin Slow-Cooking</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Place the beef and vegetables in the large pot over the campfire.</li>
        <li>Slowly simmer the stew, watching the cooking progress. Stir occasionally to prevent burning and ensure even cooking.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 3: Add Seasonings and Broth</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Once the beef is tender, add the seasonings and broth to enhance the stew’s flavor.</li>
        <li>Make sure to add the right amount of broth and spices, as too little can result in a bland stew and too much can make it watery.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 4: Final Cooking Stage</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Allow the stew to cook for the final few minutes. Stir in any additional herbs or flavorings to boost the taste.</li>
        <li>Once the stew is cooked to perfection, prepare the serving bowl.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 5: Serve</h3>
      
      <p>Once the stew is fully prepared, serve it hot to the customer. Be sure to deliver it before the time runs out to maintain a high rating.</p>
      
      <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Slow-Cooking Management:</strong> Patience is key. Don’t rush the slow-cooking process as the flavors need time to develop. Stir regularly to ensure everything is evenly cooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch for Broth Consistency:</strong> Keep an eye on the broth’s level. Add more if it’s evaporating too quickly, but don’t overdo it.</li>
        <li><strong>Ingredient Timing:</strong> Be aware of how each ingredient interacts during the cooking process. Some veggies need more time to soften than others.</li>
        <li><strong>Multitask Wisely:</strong> While waiting for the stew to simmer, use that time to prepare other dishes or stock ingredients for the next batch of stew.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch Customer Preferences:</strong> Some customers prefer more broth or certain spices. Keep track of these orders to avoid mistakes.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      
      <p>Level 62 tests your ability to manage time and ingredients effectively, as you prepare a delicious Campfire Beef Stew from scratch. Success in this level requires patience, timing, and the ability to multitask in a slow-cooking environment. Master this level to unlock more hearty stew recipes and campfire cooking upgrades.</p>

      <h2>Level Overview</h2>
      
      <p>Level 63 brings a fun and relaxed Beachside Barbecue experience. You’ll need to grill various meats and seafood, serve fresh sides, and make sure everything is cooked to perfection while managing the beach setting.</p>
      
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      
      <p>Grill a variety of meats and seafood, add sides like corn, coleslaw, and baked potatoes, and serve the customers before the time runs out to achieve the highest rating.</p>
      
      <h2>Cooking Process</h2>
      
      <h3>Step 1: Choose the Ingredients</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Select the right type of meat or seafood for the customer’s order—options include chicken, pork, shrimp, or fish fillets.</li>
        <li>Drag and drop the ingredients onto the grill to start cooking. Be mindful of the grilling time to avoid overcooking.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 2: Grill the Meats and Seafood</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Watch the grilling process closely. Seafood cooks quickly, while meat may take a bit longer. Flip items when prompted by visual cues to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Use the grill's heat control to adjust the cooking speed if necessary—too hot and the food burns, too low and it takes too long to cook.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Sides</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>While grilling, prepare the side dishes, such as corn on the cob, coleslaw, or baked potatoes. Some customers may request specific sides, so make sure you’re prepared.</li>
        <li>Place the sides on the serving plates as soon as they’re ready. These need to be served along with the grilled items.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 4: Serve the Meal</h3>
      
      <p>Once everything is ready, serve the grilled meats, seafood, and sides to the customer. Be quick—delays will affect your rating, and missing an item will result in a lower score.</p>
      
      <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Master Grilling Times:</strong> Different items cook at different speeds. Keep track of each item on the grill and flip them at the right time.</li>
        <li><strong>Control Grill Heat:</strong> Adjust the heat for the optimal cooking speed. High heat is great for searing meats, while low heat is perfect for seafood.</li>
        <li><strong>Side Dish Efficiency:</strong> While grilling, quickly prepare the sides to avoid wasting time. Keep the sides simple and ready to serve.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch for Customer Preferences:</strong> Pay attention to special requests for sides or specific grilling methods (e.g., well-done or medium-rare). Knowing customer preferences will help you avoid mistakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Organized:</strong> Keep the grilling and side preparations organized. Start grilling the next item while finishing the sides for the previous one.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      
      <p>Level 63 challenges your ability to manage grilling, side preparation, and serving all in a relaxed beach setting. Balancing the grill times and multitasking between sides and sauces will be key to completing this level with a high rating. Master this level to unlock more beachside barbecue recipes and upgrade your grilling station.</p>

      <h2>Level Overview</h2>
      
      <p>Level 64 introduces Dimsum, a variety of bite-sized dumplings, buns, and other traditional treats. You'll need to master the art of preparing and steaming these delicate dishes while keeping an eye on timing and customer orders.</p>
      
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      
      <p>Prepare a variety of Dimsum orders, including dumplings and steamed buns, and serve them to customers before the timer runs out. Precision and timing are key to achieving the highest rating.</p>
      
      <h2>Cooking Process</h2>
      
      <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dimsum Dough</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Start by preparing the dough for the Dimsum wrappers. Choose the right type based on the order—dumpling wrappers or steamed bun dough.</li>
        <li>Place the dough on the counter and use the dough roller to flatten it out.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 2: Add Fillings</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Select the correct fillings for the customer’s order—options include pork, shrimp, vegetables, or a mix of these.</li>
        <li>Place the filling in the center of the dough, and fold it neatly into a dumpling or bun shape. Be careful not to overstuff, as this can cause them to burst during steaming.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 3: Steam the Dimsum</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Place the shaped dumplings or buns into a steaming basket and transfer them to the steamer.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the cooking time. Too short, and the Dimsum will be undercooked; too long, and they’ll lose their delicate texture.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 4: Serve the Dimsum</h3>
      
      <p>Once the Dimsum is steamed to perfection, place it on the serving plate and deliver it to the customer. Be quick—delays can lead to a lower rating.</p>
      
      <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Master Steaming Times:</strong> Steaming is the most critical part. Keep track of your steamer, as the cooking time for different Dimsum items can vary.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Visual Cues:</strong> Watch for visual cues to tell when the Dimsum is ready. The steamers will show an indicator when the cooking process is complete.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient Dough Handling:</strong> Don’t waste time rolling the dough. Set up multiple stations and work in batches for faster prep.</li>
        <li><strong>Multitask:</strong> While the Dimsum is steaming, begin preparing the next batch or start on fillings for the next order to speed up your workflow.</li>
        <li><strong>Precision with Fillings:</strong> Be careful with the amount of filling you use. Overstuffed dumplings can burst, and too little filling results in a disappointing dish.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      
      <p>Level 64 is all about precision and timing as you prepare Dimsum, a traditional and delicate dish. Mastering dough handling, filling the dumplings and buns correctly, and perfectly timing the steaming process will be crucial for success. Completing this level will unlock more advanced Dimsum recipes and allow you to upgrade your kitchen for faster preparation.</p>

      <h2>Level Overview</h2>
  
      <p>Level 66 takes players to a sizzling new challenge—preparing a perfectly seared steak using a traditional hot stone grill. Timing and precision are everything as you cook to your guests' exact preferences.</p>
  
      <h2>Objective</h2>
  
      <p>Cook and serve hot stone steaks with the desired doneness (rare, medium, or well-done), using proper seasoning and plating techniques. Don't let the meat burn!</p>
  
      <h2>Grilling Process</h2>
  
      <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Stone</h3>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure the hot stone reaches optimal searing temperature before placing the steak.</li>
        <li>Watch for the glowing red color and steam to indicate readiness.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Step 2: Place and Sear the Steak</h3>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Use tongs to gently lay the steak onto the hot surface—listen for the sizzle.</li>
        <li>Flip the steak at the right interval depending on the doneness level requested.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Step 3: Season While Cooking</h3>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Season the steak with salt, pepper, and optional ingredients (e.g., garlic butter or rosemary) while it sears.</li>
        <li>Timing is crucial—season too early or too late and the flavor won't be optimal.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Step 4: Plate the Steak</h3>
  
      <p>Once cooked, transfer the steak to a wooden board or ceramic plate. Add garnish (microgreens, roasted garlic) and serve with elegance.</p>
  
      <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
  
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Memorize Cook Times:</strong> Learn the searing time for rare (10s/side), medium (15s/side), and well-done (20s/side).</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcrowd:</strong> Only cook 1–2 steaks at a time to avoid temperature drops.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Visual Cues:</strong> Watch for juice levels and texture changes to judge doneness if you're unsure.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep Tongs Clean:</strong> Wipe or switch utensils between steaks to avoid cross-flavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Immediately:</strong> Delay in plating causes the steak to overcook slightly on the hot stone.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Summary</h2>
  
      <p>Cookingdom Level 66 raises the heat with hot stone steak preparation. Mastering steak doneness, seasoning timing, and quick plating will earn you three stars and unlock new grilling ingredients and tools for future levels.</p>
