    <h2>Popcorn Mastery: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

    <h3>Step 1. Harvest Your Corn</h3>
    <p>
      In the cornfield scene, start by using the **magnifying glass** on the
      scarecrow's face to trigger the next action. Then, carefully drag **5 ripe
      corn cobs** from their stalks into the nest/hole located at the bottom of the
      screen.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
      üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ensure you gather precisely 5 corn cobs. A
      heart icon will appear to confirm you've completed this step successfully.
    </div>

    <h3>Step 2. Prepare the Corn Cob</h3>
    <p>
      Take one corn cob and peel back both layers of the green husk by dragging
      them downwards from the left and right sides. Next, remove the three sections
      of brown corn silk by dragging them off the cob.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
      üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Completing both the husk peeling and silk removal
      will trigger heart icons, signaling successful preparation.
    </div>

    <h3>Step 3. Collect the Kernels</h3>
    <p>
      Drag your finger (indicated by a white dot) repeatedly up and down the now
      exposed corn cob. This action will strip all the yellow kernels directly into
      the waiting white bowl.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
      üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Make sure every single kernel is removed from
      the cob. A heart will appear once you're done.
    </div>

    <h3>Step 4. Chop the Brown Ingredient</h3>
    <p>
      Use your **knife tool** to repeatedly slice or shave the brown block
      positioned on the cutting board. Continue until the entire block has been
      processed.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
      üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> A continuous chopping motion is required here. A
      heart icon will confirm completion.
    </div>

    <h3>Step 5. Mix Ingredients & Prep Machine</h3>
    <p>
      First, pour **oil** from the bottle directly into the red popcorn machine.
      Then, add the small **pat of butter**, the **chopped brown ingredient**, and a
      spoonful of **sugar** to the bowl containing your corn kernels.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
      üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Double-check your placements: oil goes into the
      machine, while butter, the chopped block, and sugar go into the kernel bowl.
    </div>

    <h3>Step 6. Make That Popcorn!</h3>
    <p>
      Use the **scoop** to transfer the mixed kernels from their bowl into the top
      opening of the popcorn machine. Next, press the **power button** on the
      machine. Now, simply wait for the popcorn to begin popping and fill the
      striped bucket below.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
      üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The machine will automatically start popping once
      it's switched on.
    </div>

    <h3>Step 7. Serve for Movie Night</h3>
    <p>
      The scene will transition to a cozy living room where two capybaras are
      enjoying TV. The male capybara will bring the freshly popped bucket of
      popcorn and share it with the female capybara.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
      üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> This final heartwarming scene signifies the
      completion of the level and will lead you to the results screen.
    </div>

<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>cookingdom Level 12 Prepare the Ramen Broth:</h3>
        <p>The first step in making Ramen is to prepare the broth. cookingdom Level 12 will guide you through the process of adding ingredients to a pot to create the perfect broth. Typically, a rich, savory broth is made from a mix of water, soy sauce, miso, and/or chicken stock.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> In cookingdom Level 12 , you'll be able to adjust the flavor by adding ingredients like garlic, ginger, or green onions. Make sure to simmer the broth for the right amount of time so it becomes rich and flavorful.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep an eye on the temperature. If the broth is too hot or too cold, it may not have the right consistency. Stir occasionally to avoid burning or over-reduction.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>cookingdom Level 12 Cook the Ramen Noodles:</h3>
        <p>While the broth is simmering, start cooking the ramen noodles. In cookingdom Level 12 , the noodles will cook quickly, usually in just a few minutes. Add the noodles to boiling water, and ensure they don't stick together.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Stir the noodles occasionally to keep them separated. You'll know the noodles are ready when they become tender but still firm to the bite.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Timing is crucial here! Undercooked noodles will be too chewy, while overcooked noodles will turn mushy. Keep an eye on the timer to ensure the noodles are cooked to perfection.</p>

</ol>

<h2 id="tips">cookingdom Level 12 Tips & Tricks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Perfect Broth:</strong> The broth is the soul of the ramen, so make sure to get the seasoning just right. Experiment with different ingredients to adjust the flavor to your liking.

    <li>
        <strong>Time the Noodles:</strong> cookingdom Level 12 challenges you with cooking ramen noodles just right. Keep a close eye on the timer and stir the noodles to prevent clumping. If the noodles overcook, they'll lose their texture, and your customers won't be satisfied.

Consider upgrading your pot for faster broth preparation or a larger stove to cook noodles more efficiently. This can save you time and help you meet customer demands more quickly.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Multitasking:</strong> In cookingdom Level 12 , you'll likely have several orders to manage at once. Start the broth early and cook the noodles while preparing the toppings to save time. Managing multiple elements at once is crucial to getting everything right in time.
    </li>
</ul>

  boil. Once the water is vigorously boiling, add the **sausages**. Cook them
  until the progress bar completes. Use the **fork** to carefully remove one
  cooked sausage onto a plate. (Only one sausage is needed for the final dog, even though two may appear.)
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Always wait for the water to boil before adding
  the sausages. Listen for the 'ding' sound to know when they're ready to be
  removed. A heart icon will appear after you've successfully removed the sausage.
</div>

<h3>Step 5. Mix the Special Sauce</h3>
<p>
  In the **mixing bowl**, combine the **mayonnaise, mustard, green liquid**
  (relish/juice), **salt, garlic powder, sugar, and pepper**. Use the **spoon**
  to stir everything vigorously until the mixture is fully combined and smooth.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Add *all* ingredients before you start stirring.
  Continue stirring until the mixture has a uniform color and consistency. A
  heart icon confirms completion.
</div>

<h3>Step 6. Prepare the Bun</h3>
<p>
  Place the **hotdog bun** on the **cutting board**. Use your **knife** to
  slice it open lengthwise, carefully following the dotted guide line.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> A clean, precise slice down the middle is essential
  to open the bun properly for assembly.
</div>

<h3>Step 7. Assemble Your Hotdog</h3>
<p>
  Now for assembly! First, spread your delicious **mixed sauce** inside the
  sliced bun. Then, layer in the fresh **lettuce**, followed by the saut√©ed
  **onions**, and finally the diced **pickles**. Carefully place the cooked
  **sausage** on top of all these flavorful fillings.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Follow the layering order strictly: Sauce ‚Üí
  Lettuce ‚Üí Onions ‚Üí Pickles ‚Üí Sausage.
</div>

<h3>Step 8. Add Final Toppings</h3>
<p>
  Almost done! Squeeze **mustard sauce** over the sausage in a zig-zag pattern.
  Then, similarly squeeze the red **chili/ketchup sauce** over the sausage.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Apply both sauces evenly for that perfect final
  touch and appealing presentation. A heart icon will appear, signifying the
  completion of your hotdog masterpiece!

<h2 id="overview">Cookingdom Level 14 Game Overview</h2>
<p>In Cookingdom Level 14 presents a slightly more sophisticated dish: Salmon with Minestrone. This level introduces a combination of two popular items ‚Äî a healthy, protein-packed salmon fillet served with a hearty, vegetable-filled minestrone soup. As with all recipes in Cookingdom Level 14, attention to detail, timing, and multitasking are essential to create the perfect dish for your customers.</p>
<p>Unlike other levels that focus on simpler items, this level challenges you to balance two complex elements at once: the salmon and the soup. Let\'s break down how to successfully prepare Salmon with Minestrone in Cookingdom Level 14.</p>

<h2 id="goal">Cookingdom Level 14 Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cook the Salmon:</strong> Salmon must be cooked perfectly ‚Äî crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. You'll need to ensure the timing is just right to avoid overcooking the fish.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Minestrone Soup:</strong> Minestrone is a hearty Italian soup made with a variety of vegetables, beans, and pasta. In Cookingdom Level 14, you'll need to carefully manage each ingredient, ensuring the soup is flavorful and cooked properly.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve Quickly:</strong> As always in Cookingdom Level 14, serving your dish quickly and fresh is key to earning a great rating. The salmon should be hot, the soup should be flavorful, and both components should be served together while still fresh and appetizing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Steps to Make Salmon with Minestrone</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Prepare the Minestrone Soup:</h3>
        <p>Start by cooking the minestrone soup. In Cookingdom Level 14, you'll begin by saut√©ing some base ingredients like onions, garlic, and carrots in a pot. Once these are softened, you'll add in the beans, vegetables, pasta, and broth.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Stir the soup regularly to ensure it doesn't stick to the pot. Once everything is combined, let the soup simmer to allow the flavors to meld together. You'll know it's ready when the vegetables are tender and the broth is rich and flavorful.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> In Cookingdom Level 14, there's a visual timer for the soup. Keep an eye on it to prevent overcooking. Overcooked soup will lose its fresh taste and texture.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Cook the Salmon:</h3>
        <p>While the soup is simmering, focus on the salmon. Place the salmon fillets on a heated grill or pan and cook them. In Cookingdom Level 14, the salmon will need to be seared on both sides for a crispy texture, while still remaining tender on the inside.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The perfect cooking time for salmon in Cookingdom Level 14 is crucial. Watch for the golden crust on the outside and check the inside for doneness. Overcooked salmon will be dry, so ensure it's just cooked through ‚Äî a slight pinkness inside is okay for perfect salmon.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can add seasoning or a splash of lemon juice to enhance the flavor of the salmon.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Combine the Dish:</h3>
        <p>Once both the salmon and the minestrone soup are ready, it's time to plate the dish. Begin by ladling the soup into a bowl, ensuring there's a nice balance of vegetables, pasta, and broth. Place the cooked salmon fillet alongside the soup, making sure the salmon is positioned neatly to complement the soup's presentation.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Presentation matters in Cookingdom Level 14! Arrange the salmon nicely on the plate, and make sure the soup is served with a generous amount of vegetables and pasta.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Serve the Dish:</h3>
        <p>After plating the Salmon with Minestrone, it's time to serve. Make sure both the salmon and the soup are hot. Cookingdom Level 14 customers expect fresh, hot meals, and serving the dish quickly will help increase your rating.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't wait too long to serve the dish. The longer it sits, the colder it gets, and cold food can lead to dissatisfied customers.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips">Tips & Tricks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Perfectly Cooked Salmon:</strong> To avoid overcooking the salmon, use a visual timer or watch the color change. The salmon should have a nice golden-brown crust on the outside, while still being tender and slightly pink inside. Don't leave it on the grill too long.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Balance the Minestrone Soup:</strong> Cookingdom Level 14 requires that you maintain a balance between the different elements of the minestrone soup, such as pasta, vegetables, and beans. Make sure you add the right amount of each ingredient to avoid one overpowering the others.
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the soup is too thick, add a little extra broth or water to loosen it up before serving.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Timing is Everything:</strong> Managing the cooking time for both the salmon and the soup at the same time can be challenging. Use multitasking skills to ensure the salmon doesn't overcook while the soup finishes simmering.
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can start the soup cooking first, then focus on the salmon. This way, the soup will have plenty of time to simmer while you finish cooking the fish.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Upgrade Your Kitchen:</strong> As you progress through Cookingdom Level 14, consider upgrading your kitchen equipment. A faster cooking process for both the salmon and the soup will help you handle more orders in less time, allowing you to increase efficiency and customer satisfaction.
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Upgrade your stove for faster cooking times, and look for ways to speed up the soup simmering process.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Serve the Dish Hot:</strong> Freshness is key in Cookingdom Level 14, so make sure to serve the dish as soon as both the salmon and soup are ready. Cold or lukewarm food will lead to disappointed customers and lower ratings.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In Cookingdom Level 14, preparing Salmon with Minestrone requires precision and multitasking. Cooking the salmon to the perfect level of tenderness and crispiness, while simmering the soup to a flavorful finish, can be tricky but rewarding. Managing both elements at once and serving them hot and fresh will ensure your customers leave satisfied.</p>
<p>By focusing on perfect timing, balancing the flavors of the soup, and ensuring the salmon is cooked just right, you'll master this dish in no time. Continue upgrading your equipment and refining your skills to handle the increasing complexity of dishes as you progress through Cookingdom!</p>

<h2>Chicken Fried Mastery: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

<h3>Step 1. Prepare Your Flavorful Marinade</h3>
<p>
  In a large glass bowl, combine the **dark sauce, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise,
  black pepper, salt**, and the full contents of the **noodle seasoning
  packet**. Use the **spoon** to mix all these ingredients thoroughly until
  they're perfectly blended.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ensure all sauces and seasonings are well
  combined; this is crucial for an even, delicious flavor in every bite.
</div>

<h3>Step 2. Marinate the Chicken Pieces</h3>
<p>
  Add the raw **chicken pieces** to the bowl containing your freshly prepared
  marinade. Toss or stir the chicken to ensure every single piece is completely
  coated with the marinade.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Take your time to ensure every part of the
  chicken makes good contact with the marinade for maximum flavor absorption.
</div>

<h3>Step 3. Prepare the Crispy Breading Mix whisk</h3>
<p>
  In a second large glass bowl, add the **flour (white powder), yellow powder 1,
  salt, red powder**, and **yellow powder 2**. Use the **whisk** to combine
  these dry ingredients evenly until they form a consistent mixture.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Mixing the dry ingredients well is key to
  achieving a uniform, crispy crust on your chicken.
</div>

<h3>Step 4. Heat Your Frying Oil</h3>
<p>
  Pour **cooking oil** from the flask into the **frying pan** that's already
  placed on the **induction cooktop**. Turn on the cooktop to begin heating the
  oil.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Make sure the oil reaches a sufficient
  temperature before you add the chicken. Oil that isn't hot enough will result
  in greasy, rather than crispy, fried chicken.
</div>

<h3>Step 5. Bread and Fry the Chicken</h3>
<p>
  Take each marinated **chicken piece** and fully dip it into the **breading
  mixture**, ensuring it's completely coated. Carefully place each breaded
  chicken piece into the hot oil in the frying pan. Fry them until all pieces
  are beautifully golden brown and appear thoroughly cooked through.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Coat the chicken generously in breading. Don't
  crowd the pan; fry in batches if necessary to maintain oil temperature and
  ensure even cooking.
</div>

<h3>Step 6. Drain the Fried Chicken</h3>
<p>
  Using the **spider strainer**, carefully lift the cooked **fried chicken
  pieces** out of the hot oil. Place them onto **absorbent paper** (this is
  implied in the game) to drain any excess oil.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Proper draining is essential for keeping your
  fried chicken wonderfully crispy, not greasy.
</div>

<h3>Step 7. Plate Your Delicious Dish</h3>
<p>
  Arrange the fresh **lettuce leaves** neatly on the **serving plate** to create
  a vibrant base. Place the drained **fried chicken pieces** on top of the
  lettuce. Dispense **chili sauce** from its bottle into the small **dipping
  bowl**. Finally, position the bowl of **french fries** and the dipping sauce
  bowl attractively alongside the chicken in the serving area.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Arrange all components aesthetically for a
  stunning final presentation!
</div>

<h2>Steak Perfection: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

<h3>Step 1. Select Your Recipe</h3>
<p>
  Begin by opening the cookbook and choosing **Recipe No. 8 (Steak)**.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Just make sure you have the necessary ingredients
  unlocked before you start!
</div>

<h3>Step 2. Season Your Steaks</h3>
<p>
  Place the two **steaks** onto a plate. Drag the **salt shaker** over both
  steaks to season them generously. Then, do the same with the **pepper
  shaker**, covering both steaks.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ensure both sides of each steak are thoroughly
  seasoned by dragging your cursor over the entire steak area.
</div>

<h3>Step 3. Prepare and Add Minced Garlic</h3>
<p>
  Take one **garlic bulb** and place it onto the **cutting board**. Use your
  **knife** to repeatedly chop the garlic until it's finely minced. Once
  minced, drag the prepared garlic onto your seasoned steaks.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Chop the garlic thoroughly for the best flavor
  distribution. A heart icon will confirm when the garlic is correctly applied.
</div>

<h3>Step 4. Drizzle with Oil</h3>
<p>
  Pour **oil** from the bottle directly over your seasoned steaks and the
  minced garlic.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ensure the oil coats both steaks evenly. A heart
  icon will confirm successful application.
</div>

<h3>Step 5. Prepare Side Vegetables (Preliminary Cuts)</h3>
<p>
  Place a **potato** on the **cutting board** and use your **knife** to slice
  it neatly in half (you'll use both halves later). Next, take the second
  **garlic bulb**, place it on the board, and simply slice off the top.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> These vegetables are being prepped now, but they
  will be cooked later in the pan, absorbing residual flavors.
</div>

<h3>Step 6. Heat Pan and Sear Steaks</h3>
<p>
  Place the **frying pan** on the **stove** and turn on the heat. Add the **pat
  of butter** and allow it to melt completely. Once melted and hot, carefully
  add your seasoned **steaks** to the pan and cook until one side is perfectly
  seared with a nice crust.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Listen for that satisfying sizzle! Avoid
  overcrowding the pan; give your steaks space to sear properly.
</div>

<h3>Step 7. Remove Steaks, Cook Sides</h3>
<p>
  Remove the seared **steaks** from the pan and temporarily set them aside on
  the **cutting board**. Now, add your prepared side vegetables ‚Äì the cut
  **garlic bulb**, **potato halves, carrot**, and **green peppercorns** ‚Äì to
  the *same* pan with the residual butter and steak drippings. Saut√© until
  they are cooked through and tender-crisp.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Cooking the vegetables in the same pan allows
  them to absorb all those delicious, savory flavors left by the steak.
</div>

<h3>Step 8. Remove Sides and Create Pan Sauce</h3>
<p>
  Once cooked, remove the vegetables from the pan and place them on a side
  tray. Now, pour the **soy sauce** (from the bottle labeled 'Sauce') into the
  hot pan. Let it bubble and reduce slightly to create a rich pan sauce.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of
  the pan into the sauce; these bits are packed with extra flavor!
</div>

<h3>Step 9. Slice the Steak</h3>
<p>
  Take one of your seared **steaks** and place it onto the **cutting board**.
  Use your **knife** to slice the steak into several even pieces.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For real-world tenderness, you'd slice against
  the grain, but in the game, simply follow the visual guides for even cuts.
</div>

<h3>Step 10. Plate Your Masterpiece</h3>
<p>
  Place the fresh **parsley sprig** on the large **serving plate**. Arrange
  your sliced **steak** attractively over the parsley. Now, add your cooked
  side vegetables ‚Äì the **garlic, carrots, potatoes, and peppercorns** ‚Äì along
  with the halved **cherry tomatoes** around the steak.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Arrange all components thoughtfully and
  aesthetically for the best possible presentation score.
</div>

<h3>Step 11. Add Sauces and Serve!</h3>
<p>
  Use a **spoon** to drizzle your freshly made **pan sauce** generously over
  the sliced steak. Finally, place the small bowl of **yellow dipping sauce**
  (like Hollandaise or B√©arnaise) neatly next to your plated steak.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ensure the pan sauce covers the steak nicely. The
  dipping sauce is the finishing touch that completes your dish.
</div>

<h2>Top Tips for Cookingdom Level 16 Success</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    ‚úîÔ∏è **Season the steak generously** with salt, pepper, and minced garlic
    before you start cooking.
  </li>
  <li>
    ‚úîÔ∏è Always ensure your **pan is hot** before adding butter and steak to
    achieve a perfect sear and avoid a gray, unappealing crust.
  </li>
  <li>
    ‚úîÔ∏è **Cook the side vegetables in the same pan** immediately after the
    steak; they'll absorb all those wonderful residual flavors.
  </li>
  <li>
    ‚úîÔ∏è Don't forget the **final pan sauce drizzle** over the steak and the
    **side dipping sauce**; both are essential for completion.
  </li>
  <li>
    ‚úîÔ∏è Arrange all elements **neatly and attractively** on the plate for the
    highest presentation score.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid in Cookingdom Level 16</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Forgetting to season the steak with any of the required salt, pepper, or garlic.</li>
  <li>Adding the steak to a cold pan, which will prevent a good, flavorful sear.</li>
  <li>Burning the butter, garlic, or side vegetables during cooking.</li>
  <li>Overcooking the steak, resulting in a tough and undesirable texture (often visually represented).</li>
  <li>Forgetting to add the crucial pan sauce or the accompanying yellow dipping sauce.</li>
  <li>Messy plating or missing key vegetable components like the cherry tomatoes during the final arrangement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Caf√© Macchiato Mastery: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

<h3>Step 1. Harvest Coffee Cherries</h3>
<p>
  Begin by swiping away the large leaves that cover the **coffee bushes**. Once
  revealed, tap the clusters of multi-colored **coffee cherries** to collect
  them. Continue doing this until the woven basket is completely full.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Make sure to uncover and collect *all* the cherry
  clusters. A heart icon will appear once the basket is full, confirming
  completion.
</div>

<h3>Step 2. Process Cherries (Pulping)</h3>
<p>
  Drag the filled basket of **cherries** to pour them into the hopper of the
  red hand-cranked pulping machine. Then, drag the crank handle in a circular
  motion to process the cherries, separating the beans into the purple bowl
  below.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep cranking consistently until all cherries
  are processed. Heart icons will confirm both the pouring and the completion
  of processing.
</div>

<h3>Step 3. Dry the Beans</h3>
<p>
  Pour the pulped **beans** from the purple bowl onto the drying tray. Next,
  swipe away any clouds that are covering the sun icon above the tray. Wait for
  the timer to complete as the beans dry and turn a uniform brown.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Clearing the clouds is essential to start the
  drying process. A heart icon will appear when the beans are perfectly dry.
</div>

<h3>Step 4. Roast the beans stirring</h3>
<p>
  Turn on the **hotplate**. Use the **scoop** to transfer the dried brown
  **beans** into the pan placed on the hotplate. Now, grab the **spatula** and
  continuously stir the beans as they roast and darken.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Constant stirring is vital to prevent burning
  and ensure even roasting. Heart icons will appear after adding beans and
  again after successful stirring.
</div>

<h3>Step 5. Grind the Beans</h3>
<p>
  Pour the roasted **beans** from the pan into the yellow **blender**. Place
  the lid firmly on top, then press the power button. Wait for the blender to
  grind the beans into a fine coffee powder.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Always ensure the lid is securely on before
  pressing the power button. A heart icon will confirm the grinding is
  complete.
</div>

<h3>Step 6. Make the Syrup</h3>
<p>
  Turn on a **hotplate**. Add **sugar** from the bowl and **water** from the
  pitcher into a pan. Stir well with the **spatula**. Squeeze the juice from a
  **lemon half** into the pan. Continue stirring until the mixture thickens and
  transforms into a glossy brown syrup.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Follow the precise sequence of adding
  ingredients and keep stirring consistently. Heart icons will appear at
  various stages: adding ingredients, squeezing lemon, and finally, upon syrup
  completion.
</div>

<h3>Step 7. Steam Milk</h3>
<p>
  Pour **milk** from the carton into the glass beaker. Place the beaker inside
  the small oven/steamer machine. Wait for the timer to complete as the milk
  heats up to the perfect temperature.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ensure the beaker is correctly placed in the
  machine. A heart icon will appear once steaming is complete.
</div>

<h3>Step 8. Froth Milk</h3>
<p>
  Take the beaker of steamed milk out of the machine. Insert the **immersion
  blender** into the beaker and operate it until the milk becomes wonderfully
  thick and frothy.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep blending until the milk reaches the desired
  airy, frothy consistency. A heart icon indicates success.
</div>

<h3>Step 9. Brew Espresso</h3>
<p>
  Use the **spoon** to add ground coffee powder into the espresso machine's
  **portafilter**. Use the **tamper** to press the grounds down firmly and
  evenly. Lock the portafilter into the machine. Place the small white cup
  under the spout and press the brew button. Wait for the rich espresso to brew
  into the cup.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Each action (adding grounds, tamping, brewing)
  needs to be executed correctly for a perfect shot. Heart icons will confirm
  each step's completion.
</div>

<h3>Step 10. Assemble the Macchiato</h3>
<p>
  Place the tall glass on the purple plate. Add **ice cubes** from the bowl
  into the glass. Pour the freshly brewed **espresso** over the ice. Gently
  pour the beautiful **frothed milk** on top of the espresso. Now, carefully
  drizzle the prepared **syrup** over the frothed milk in a delicate heart
  shape. Finally, add the **flower garnish** for decoration.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Layer the ingredients carefully for visual
  appeal. The syrup drizzle requires tracing a clear heart shape. Heart icons
  will appear for adding ice, espresso, milk, and the syrup drizzle.
</div>

<h2>Top Tips for Cookingdom Level 17 Success</h2>

        <p>Add the sliced vegetables one by one and stir them to ensure even cooking. Don't overcook the vegetables; they should remain tender but still have a slight bite.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Stir occasionally to prevent burning, and adjust the heat as necessary. If the vegetables start to brown too quickly, lower the heat slightly.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Simmer the Sauce:</h3>
        <p>Once the vegetables are saut√©ed, it's time to prepare the sauce. In Cookingdom Level 18 , you'll simmer a tomato-based sauce with herbs like thyme, rosemary, and basil.</p>
        <p>Add the sauce to the pan with the vegetables, and allow it to simmer. The sauce will begin to thicken and coat the vegetables, enhancing their flavor.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Let the sauce simmer gently for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Stir occasionally to prevent the sauce from sticking to the pan.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Assemble the Dish:</h3>
        <p>Once the vegetables are tender and the sauce is thick and flavorful, it's time to plate the Ratatouille. Arrange the cooked vegetables neatly in the center of the plate and spoon some of the sauce over them.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can garnish the Ratatouille with fresh herbs like basil or parsley for a burst of color and extra flavor.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Serve the Ratatouille:</h3>
        <p>After plating, serve the Ratatouille quickly while it's still hot. In Cookingdom Level 18 , speed is important, so don't let the dish sit for too long before serving it to the customers.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Serve the dish with a small side of bread or rice to complete the meal. This will make it more filling and appealing to your customers.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips">Cookingdom Level 18 Tips & Tricks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Evenly Slice the Vegetables:</h3>
        <p>The key to perfectly cooked Ratatouille is evenly sliced vegetables. Using a mandoline slicer will help ensure the slices are uniform and cook evenly.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Take your time to slice the vegetables neatly, as this will significantly impact the final presentation and texture.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Don't Overcook the Vegetables:</h3>
        <p>In Cookingdom Level 18 , it's important to saut√© the vegetables just until they're tender but not mushy. Overcooked vegetables will lose their texture and flavor.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep an eye on the heat and stir regularly to prevent burning. If the vegetables seem to be cooking too fast, reduce the heat slightly.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Perfect the Sauce:</h3>
        <p>The sauce in Ratatouille is simple but flavorful. Make sure it's well-seasoned with fresh herbs, and don't forget to simmer it gently to allow the flavors to develop.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the sauce is too thin, let it cook for a few extra minutes until it thickens. If it's too thick, add a little water or vegetable broth to reach the desired consistency.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Garnish and Present Well:</h3>
        <p>Presentation is important in Cookingdom Level 18 . After arranging the vegetables, garnish the Ratatouille with fresh herbs or a sprinkle of cheese for added flavor and a beautiful touch.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> A nice garnish can elevate the look of the dish and impress your customers. A few fresh basil leaves or a drizzle of olive oil can make a big difference.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Upgrade Your Kitchen:</h3>
        <p>As you progress in Cookingdom Level 18 , consider upgrading your cooking equipment, such as your stovetop or pan. A faster cooking process will allow you to manage multiple dishes more efficiently.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Upgrades to your kitchen tools can help speed up your cooking and ensure everything is prepared on time, especially when dealing with multiple orders.</p>
    </li>

<h2>Pumpkin Pie Perfection: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

<h3>Step 1. Prepare Your Flaky Crust Dough processor</h3>
<p>
  Open the **food processor**. Add the **salt, sugar, flour, water, brown
  spice**, and **butter**. Close the lid securely and blend until a cohesive
  dough forms.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Double-check that all crust ingredients are in
  the processor before you blend. A heart icon will appear when the dough is
  perfectly ready.
</div>

<h3>Step 2. Roll Out the Crust</h3>
<p>
  Remove the prepared **dough** from the food processor and place it onto the
  wooden board. Use the **rolling pin**, dragging it back and forth smoothly
  until the dough flattens into a perfect circle.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep rolling until a sparkle effect appears,
  indicating the dough is fully rolled out to the correct size and thickness.
</div>

<h3>Step 3. Form the Pie Crust in the Pan</h3>
<p>
  Drag the rolled **dough** from the board and carefully place it into the
  black **pie pan**, pressing it gently to form the crust shape.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> A heart icon will confirm that your crust is
  correctly placed and shaped within the pan.
</div>

<h3>Step 4. Blind Bake the Crust</h3>
<p>
  Open the **oven door**. Place the **pie pan** containing your raw crust into
  the oven. Close the door and wait for it to bake.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The crust needs this pre-baking step (often
  called 'blind baking') before you add the filling to prevent it from getting
  soggy.
</div>

<h3>Step 5. Prepare the Creamy Pumpkin Filling</h3>
<p>
  While the crust is baking, start on your filling! Add **cream, pumpkin puree,
  rum, milk, grated spice**, and the **cracked eggs** (implied to be cracked
  from a plate into the bowl) to the large mixing bowl. Use the **whisk tool**
  and swirl it around vigorously to combine all ingredients thoroughly until
  smooth.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Mix until the filling is perfectly smooth and a
  uniform orange/brown color. A heart icon (and sometimes a cat meow sound!)
  will confirm the eggs are added and mixing is complete.
</div>

<h3>Step 6. Fill the pie crust, pouring</h3>
<p>
  Remove the pre-baked **crust** from the oven. Carefully pour your prepared
  **pumpkin filling** from the mixing bowl directly into the baked crust.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ensure the filling is poured evenly into the
  crust for consistent baking.
</div>

<h3>Step 7. Bake the Pumpkin Pie</h3>
<p>
  Open the **oven door** again. Carefully place the filled **pie pan** back
  into the oven. Close the door and wait for the final baking process to
  complete.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> A heart icon will appear on the oven when your
  pumpkin pie is fully baked and ready!
</div>

<h3>Step 8. Decorate with Whipped Cream</h3>
<p>
  Remove the fully baked **pie** from the oven. Place it onto the **serving
  plate**. Select the **piping bag** and apply **6 neat dollops of whipped
  cream** evenly around the edge of the pie.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Tap or drag precisely to create neat and evenly
  spaced dollops. Completing this decoration step finishes the recipe!
</div>

<h2>Top Tips for Cookingdom Level 19 Success</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    ‚úîÔ∏è  Follow the sequence diligently: **make the crust, blind bake the crust, make the filling, fill the pie, bake the filled pie, and then decorate**
  </li>
  <li>
    ‚úîÔ∏è Ensure ingredients are **fully mixed** at both the dough and filling
    stages for optimal texture and flavor.
  </li>
  <li>
    ‚úîÔ∏è Be **precise** when piping the whipped cream; neat dollops contribute to
    a professional and high-scoring look.
  </li>
  <li>
    ‚úîÔ∏è Pay close attention to the **heart icons**; they're your confirmation that
    each step has been successfully completed.
  </li>
</ul>

  <li>Pouring the pumpkin filling into the pie crust *before* the blind baking step.</li>
  <li>Messy or uneven placement of the whipped cream dollops during the final decoration.</li>

<h2>Roast Turkey Mastery: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

<h3>Step 1. Thaw the Turkey</h3>
<p>
  Begin by removing the plastic wrap from the **frozen turkey**. Turn on the
  **sink tap**. Drag the turkey into the **sink** filled with water to thaw it.
  Once it's fully thawed (the ice effect disappears), drag it back to the
  **cutting board**.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ensure the turkey is completely thawed by being
  fully submerged or thoroughly rinsed until all ice visuals are gone.
</div>

<h3>Step 2. Wash All Produce</h3>
<p>
  Drag each individual produce item‚Äîthe **apple, onion, cauliflower, tomatoes,
  lemons**, and **parsley**‚Äîinto the **sink** with running water to thoroughly
  wash them.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Each item needs to be individually dragged into
  the water stream to register as washed.
</div>

<h3>Step 3. Dry and Plate Turkey</h3>
<p>
  Select the **paper towel roll**. Drag the paper towel over the thawed turkey
  on the cutting board to pat it completely dry. Once dry, drag the turkey onto
  the large **oval plate**.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ensure the turkey is visually dry (no more water
  spots). A heart icon will confirm successful drying.
</div>

<h3>Step 4. Prepare all ingredients, zest</h3>
<p>
  Place each washed produce item (apple, onion, cauliflower, tomatoes, lemons,
  parsley) onto the **cutting board** one by one. Use the **knife** (or the
  grater for lemon zest) to chop, slice, zest, or mince them as indicated by
  the game. Place each prepared ingredient onto its designated small plate.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Follow all cutting and zesting guides precisely.
  Heart icons will confirm correct preparation for each ingredient.
</div>

<h3>Step 5. Cook Stuffing Base</h3>
<p>
  Move to the stove area. Pour **oil** into the pan on the **induction cooker**
  and turn it on. Add all your prepared ingredients (chopped apple, sliced
  onion, cauliflower florets, chopped parsley, lemon zest, and sliced tomatoes) to
  the hot pan. Next, add **white wine, salt, pepper**, and the contents of the
  **spice shaker** (chili flakes).
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> While the specific order might not always be
  strict, adding ingredients in the sequence shown on-screen usually helps
  avoid issues.
</div>

<h3>Step 6. Saut√© and Finish Sauce</h3>
<p>
  Use the **spatula** to stir the ingredients vigorously in the pan. Continue
  stirring until the mixture cooks down into a thick, appealing orange-brown
  sauce or stuffing base. Remove the pan from the heat.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Stir continuously to prevent burning and ensure
  even cooking. A heart icon will appear once the mixture changes appearance
  and is ready.
</div>

<h3>Step 7. Coat the Turkey </h3>
<p>
  Drag the plated raw turkey back onto the **cutting board**. Use the
  **spatula** to scoop the cooked **stuffing base** from the pan and spread it
  evenly all over the turkey until it's fully coated.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ensure the entire surface of the turkey is
  covered with the sauce. The turkey will visibly change color. A heart icon
  confirms successful coating.
</div>

<h3>Step 8. Plate Coated Turkey (Pre-Roast)</h3>
<p>
  Drag the coated turkey from the cutting board back onto the large **oval
  plate**.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> This is a simple transfer step to prepare the
  turkey for roasting.
</div>

<h3>Step 9. Roast the turkey in the oven</h3>
<p>
  Move to the oven area. Open the **oven door**. Carefully place the plated,
  coated turkey inside. Close the door. Now, interact with the **oven dials**
  to set the correct temperature and roasting time as indicated by the game.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Setting the dials correctly is absolutely
  crucial for a perfectly roasted turkey. Heart icons will appear for correct
  settings. Wait for the oven's timer sound or visual cue.
</div>

<h3>Step 10. Prepare Garnish Plate</h3>
<p>
  While the turkey roasts (or after it's done), move to the final plating area.
  Drag the various **garnish items** (parsley sprigs, lemon slices, tomato
  slices, onion slices, apple slices) from the surrounding area onto the large
  purple-rimmed **serving plate**.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Arrange the garnishes neatly and attractively
  around the edge of the plate as shown in the game's example.
</div>

<h3>Step 11. Final Plating</h3>
<p>
  Once the oven timer finishes and your turkey is beautifully roasted
  (indicated by the oven's 'ding' and a visual change), the oven door will
  open. Drag the roasted turkey (still on its oval plate) from the oven onto
  the center of your pre-garnished **serving plate**.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Place the turkey centrally and symmetrically on
  your prepared plate. A sparkle animation signifies the completion of your
  magnificent roast!
