    detailsHtml: `<h2>Game Introduction</h2>
<p>In Level 1 of Cookingdom, players learn how to make and serve pizza, one of the most basic dishes in the game. This level focuses on familiarizing players with the cooking process, ingredient preparation, and the basic rhythm of restaurant operation.</p>
<h2>Level 1 Goal</h2>
<p>You will be required to make and serve the first pizza to a customer. Making pizza involves several steps, including preparing ingredients, baking, and serving. The goal is to satisfy customer needs quickly and accurately to complete the task.</p>
<h2>Pizza Making Process</h2>
<h3>Prepare Pizza Ingredients:</h3>
<p>First, gather the basic ingredients: pizza base, tomato sauce, cheese, and other toppings (like sausage, mushrooms).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pizza Base:</strong> Grab a pizza base from the ingredient area.</li>
  <li><strong>Tomato Sauce:</strong> Spread tomato sauce evenly on the base.</li>
  <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Sprinkle cheese, ensuring even coverage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Add Toppings:</h3>
<p>In Level 1, toppings are simple. Use basic ones like sausage or mushrooms.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drag toppings onto the pizza, ensuring even distribution. This enhances flavor and customer satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bake the Pizza:</h3>
<p>Place the prepared pizza into the oven.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Baking time is crucial. Overbaking burns the pizza; underbaking leaves it raw.</p>
<p>Monitor the pizza's progress closely during baking to ensure perfect color and texture.</p>
<h3>Check Pizza Doneness:</h3>
<p>Observe the pizza's appearance. When it turns golden brown and smells fragrant, it's ready.</p>
<p>Overbaked pizza becomes charred and tastes bad, potentially dissatisfying customers.</p>
<h3>Serve the Pizza:</h3>
<p>Remove the baked pizza from the oven and immediately deliver it to the customer's table.</p>
<p>Timing is important: Long waits decrease customer satisfaction, affecting your score and rewards.</p>
<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Learn to manage time, especially with cooking and prep. Precise oven control is needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Prepare Ingredients in Advance:</strong> While waiting for the pizza to bake, prepare other ingredients or clean the kitchen. Prep ahead for faster serving.</li>
  <li><strong>Oven Operation:</strong> Familiarize yourself with the oven. Each food has different baking times; master them.</li>
  <li><strong>Customer Patience:</strong> Long waits decrease patience and scores. Speed up service.</li>
  <li><strong>Practice Multitasking:</strong> While baking, prep other items or clean to improve efficiency. Later levels have more customers and dishes, so practice helps.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Making the first pizza is an introductory task in Cookingdom. It familiarizes you with cooking and serving basics, ingredient management, cooking time control, and customer needs. The goal is to understand basic time management and preparation skills for more complex levels ahead.</p>
<p>Completing Level 1 grants coins and score rewards, unlocking more kitchen equipment and recipes for a richer game experience.</p>`,

<h2>Step-by-Step Fried Potato Walkthrough</h2>

<h3>Step 1. Harvest Potatoes (Mini-game)</h3>
<p>
  Tap and hold the **potato plant stem** to pull the potatoes out of the ground.
  Drag the individual good potatoes hanging from the roots into the **sack on
  the left** (marked with a potato symbol). Avoid the sack on the right (marked
  with an 'X').
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Quickly drag all the potatoes into the correct sack
  before they retract.
</p>

<h3>Step 2. Wash Potatoes</h3>
<p>
  At the sink station, tap the **drain plug button**. Turn on the **faucet** by
  tapping it to fill the sink with water. Drag the dirty potatoes from the sack
  into the sink one by one. Once clean (sparkling), drag them onto the **pink
  tray** nearby. Turn off the faucet.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure all potatoes are washed until they
  sparkle.
</p>

<h3>Step 3. Peel and Cut Potatoes</h3>
<p>
  Place one potato on the **cutting board**. Select the **peeler tool** and
  drag it across the potato until fully peeled. Select the **knife**. Drag it
  vertically down the center guide, then repeatedly drag it horizontally across
  the guides to cut it into fries. Move the cut fries into the **blue bowl**.
  Repeat for the remaining two potatoes.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Follow the cutting guides accurately for uniform
  fries.
</p>

<h3>Step 4. Blanch the fries in boiling water</h3>
<p>
  Place the **pot** under the faucet and fill it with water. Move the pot onto
  the **induction cooktop**. Place the **lid** on the pot and turn on the
  cooktop. Wait for the water to boil (indicated by bubbles). Remove the lid.
  Add the cut fries from the blue bowl into the boiling water. Wait until they
  turn slightly pale (blanched). Use the **spider strainer** to scoop the fries
  out and place them onto the **paper towel-lined grey tray**.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Don't overcook during blanching; they just need a
  brief boil.
</p>

<h3>Step 5. Fry the Potatoes</h3>
<p>
  Place the **frying pan** on the cooktop and turn it on. Add **oil** from the
  bottle into the pan and wait for it to heat up (shimmering). Pour **flour**
  from the bowl into the **plastic container**. Add the blanched fries into the
  container. Close the lid and shake vigorously (tap/drag rapidly) until the
  fries are coated. Open the lid. Add the flour-coated fries to the hot oil in
  the pan. Fry until golden brown. Use the **spider strainer** to remove the
  cooked fries and place them onto the fresh paper towel on the tray.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Ensure the oil is hot before adding fries. Shake
  well for even flour coating. Fry to a nice golden color.
</p>

<h3>Step 6. Plate the Fried Potatoes</h3>
<p>
  Move the cooked fries from the paper towel onto the **white plate**. Select
  the **salt shaker** and sprinkle salt over the fries. Select the **ketchup
  bottle** and squeeze ketchup into the **small dipping bowl**. Place the
  dipping bowl on the plate next to the fries.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Arrange the fries nicely, and don't forget the salt
  and ketchup dip.
</p>

<h2>Tips and Tricks for Cookingdom Level 2</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    In the mini-game, be sure to put potatoes only in the sack with the
    potato icon.
  </li>
  <li>Wash each potato thoroughly in the sink.</li>
  <li>Peel completely and cut following the guides for even cooking.</li>
  <li>
    Blanching briefly helps create a fluffy interior and crispy exterior.
  </li>
  <li>Ensure oil is properly heated before frying for crispiness.</li>
  <li>Shake the container well to get an even coating of flour.</li>
  <li>Drain the fries well after blanching and frying.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid in Cookingdom Level 2</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Placing potatoes in the wrong sack during harvesting.</li>
  <li>Forgetting to wash or peel the potatoes.</li>
  <li>Cutting fries too thick or unevenly.</li>
  <li>Add fries to cold water for blanching or cold oil for frying.</li>
  <li>Overcooking or undercooking the fries during blanching or frying.</li>
  <li>Not coating the fries properly with flour.</li>
  <li>Forgetting to add salt or the ketchup dip during plating.</li>

<h2>Step-by-Step Rolled Ice-Cream Walkthrough</h2>

<h3>Step 1. Add Base and Fruit</h3>
<p>
  Using the scoop, place **two dollops of white ice cream base** onto the cold
  plate. Select either **banana or kiwi** and place the fruit pieces onto the
  base.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Ensure fruit is added before mixing. A heart icon
  confirms correct placement.
</p>

<h3>Step 2. Chop and Mix Fruit</h3>
<p>
  Take the **two spatulas** and repeatedly chop the fruit into the ice cream
  base on the cold plate, mixing them thoroughly.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Mix until the fruit is well incorporated. A heart
  icon appears when sufficiently mixed.
</p>

<h3>Step 3. Add Milk 🥛</h3>
<p>
  Pour **milk** from the carton over the chopped fruit and ice cream mixture
  spread on the plate.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Pour evenly across the mixture. Wait for the heart
  icon confirmation.
</p>

<h3>Step 4. Spread Mixture Thinly</h3>
<p>
  Quickly use the **spatulas** to spread the liquid mixture into a **thin, even
  rectangular layer** across the entire cold plate. Scrape vertical lines to
  divide the layer into strips.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Work fast before it freezes too hard. An even, thin
  layer is crucial for good rolls. A heart icon appears after spreading.
</p>

<h3>Step 5. Roll the Ice Cream</h3>
<p>
  Position a **spatula** at the bottom edge of one strip. Push forward firmly
  at about a 45-degree angle to scrape the ice cream layer off the plate,
  causing it to curl into a roll. Repeat for all strips.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Consistent pressure and angle are key for neat
  rolls. A heart icon appears when all strips are rolled.
</p>

<h3>Step 6. Transfer Rolls to Bowl</h3>
<p>
  Carefully use the **spatula** to lift each completed ice cream roll and place
  it upright into the **blue serving bowl**.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Arrange the rolls neatly to fill the bowl.
</p>

<h3>Step 7. Add Toppings 🎉</h3>
<p>
  Sprinkle the **colorful candy bits** over the ice cream rolls in the bowl.
  Add the **chocolate syrup swirls**. Finally, insert pieces of **chocolate
  bar** and **wafer sticks**.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Follow the topping order shown: Sprinkles -> Syrup
  Swirls -> Chocolate/Wafers. Heart icons appear after adding syrup and
  chocolate/wafers.
</p>

<h3>Step 8. Repeat for Second Variation</h3>
<p>
  Make a second bowl of rolled ice cream using the *other* fruit (if you used
  banana first, use kiwi now, and vice versa). Follow all previous steps (1-7)
  for this second bowl.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> The customer requires both variations (Banana and
  Kiwi) to complete the level successfully.
</p>

<h2>Tips and Tricks for Cookingdom Level 4</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    ✔️ **Speed is important** when spreading the mixture on the cold plate.
  </li>
  <li>✔️ Ensure the mixture is spread **very thinly** for easier rolling.</li>
  <li>
    ✔️ Mastering the **scraping angle** is key to getting perfect, unbroken
    rolls.
  </li>
  <li>
    ✔️ Remember to make **both the banana and kiwi variations** to satisfy the
    customer.
  </li>
  <li>✔️ Add toppings in the **correct sequence** shown in the video.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid in Cookingdom Level 3</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Spreading the ice cream base too thick, making it hard to roll.</li>
  <li>Not mixing the fruit and base thoroughly enough.</li>
  <li>Rolling too slowly or with incorrect pressure/angle, causing rolls to break.</li>
  <li>Forgetting to add milk.</li>
  <li>Missing toppings or adding them in the wrong order.</li>
  <li>Only preparing one fruit variation instead of the required two.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-Step Simple Salad Walkthrough</h2>

<h3>Step 1. Wash Vegetables</h3>
<p>
  At the sink station, turn on the **faucet**. Drag the **lettuce, avocado,
  tomato, onion, red cabbage, and carrot** into the sink one by one. Wait for
  each to sparkle, indicating it's clean. Place washed vegetables into the
  **temporary containers**. Turn off the faucet.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Ensure every vegetable sparkles before removing it
  from the sink.
</p>

<h3>Step 2. Cut Lettuce</h3>
<p>
  Place the washed **lettuce** onto the **cutting board**. Select the **knife
  tool**. Follow the on-screen guides to cut the lettuce. Move the cut lettuce
  into the **green container**.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Align cuts with the guides for proper preparation.
</p>

<h3>Step 3. Cut Red Cabbage</h3>
<p>
  Place the washed **red cabbage wedge** onto the **cutting board**. Select the
  **knife tool** and follow the guides to shred the cabbage. Move the cut red
  cabbage into the **purple-trimmed container**.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Precise cuts along the guides ensure correct
  shredding.
</p>

<h3>Step 4. Cut Onion</h3>
<p>
  Place the washed **onion** onto the **cutting board**. Select the **knife
  tool** and follow the guides to slice it; the outer skin will be
  automatically removed. Move the cut onion into the **pink-trimmed
  container**.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Cutting according to the guides handles the peeling
  automatically.
</p>

<h3>Step 5. Cut Tomato</h3>
<p>
  Place the washed **tomato** onto the **cutting board**. Select the **knife
  tool** and follow the guides to slice the tomato. Move the sliced tomato into
  the **pink-trimmed container**.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Steady cuts following the lines create perfect
  slices.
</p>

<h3>Step 6. Peel and Cut Carrot</h3>
<p>
  Place the washed **carrot** onto the **cutting board**. Select the **peeler
  tool** and drag it over the carrot to peel it completely. Switch to the
  **knife tool** and follow the guides to dice the carrot. Move the diced
  carrot into the **purple-trimmed container**.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Ensure the carrot is fully peeled before dicing.
</p>

<h3>Step 7. Peel and Cut Avocado</h3>
<p>
  Place the washed **avocado** onto the **cutting board**. Select the **peeler
  tool** and peel the avocado. Switch to the **knife tool** and follow the
  guides to slice the avocado (the pit is removed automatically). Move the
  sliced avocado into the **green container**.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Peeling first makes slicing easier; follow the
  guides.
</p>

<h3>Step 8. Mix the Salad</h3>
<p>
  The scene shifts to the Chef Capybara. Add all the prepared ingredients (cut
  lettuce, red cabbage, onion, tomato, carrot, and avocado) from their containers
  into the large **purple mixing bowl**. Use the **two wooden servers** to toss
  the salad by tapping/dragging until the mixing progress bar is full.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Ensure all ingredients are added to the bowl before
  mixing. Mix thoroughly.
</p>

<h3>Step 9. Plate and Dress the Salad</h3>
<p>
  Arrange the **large lettuce leaves** on the **serving plate** to form a base.
  Pour the mixed salad from the purple bowl onto the lettuce leaves. Select the
  **salad dressing bottle** and drizzle the dressing over the salad in a
  crisscross pattern.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Create an appealing base with the lettuce leaves.
  Apply the dressing evenly as shown.

<h2 id="overview">Game Overview</h2>
<p>In Cookingdom, each level introduces a new cooking challenge, and in Level 5, players are tasked with preparing Grilled Fish. Compared to the previous levels, grilling fish requires careful attention to timing and heat control. You will need to master grilling techniques, ensure the fish is cooked just right, and serve your customers promptly to keep them happy.</p>
<p>As you progress in Cookingdom, new skills are unlocked, and with each new level, you'll encounter more complex recipes and customer demands. This level introduces grilling as a key technique and will test your ability to manage time efficiently in the kitchen.</p>

<h2 id="goal">Level 5 Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cook Grilled Fish:</strong> In this level, you'll learn how to grill fish to perfection. Cookingdom gives you the necessary tools to control the grill's temperature, but you must monitor the fish closely to ensure it doesn't burn or undercook. The goal is to grill the fish evenly and achieve the right texture and flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Control the Heat:</strong> Grilling fish requires precise control of heat. You need to grill the fish just long enough for it to develop a crispy, golden exterior while keeping the inside tender and moist. Overcooking or undercooking will result in unhappy customers.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficiently Serve Customers:</strong> As more customers start to arrive, you'll need to handle multiple orders at once. Cookingdom will test your ability to manage time and prioritize orders while ensuring each dish is prepared perfectly.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Steps to Make Grilled Fish</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Prepare the Fish:</h3>
        <p>First, take the fish from the ingredients area and place it on the grill. In Cookingdom, there may be different types of fish available, so make sure to select the right one based on customer requests.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the customer specifies a certain type of fish, prepare it quickly to avoid delays.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Season the Fish:</h3>
        <p>Once the fish is placed on the grill, add the appropriate seasoning. Common seasonings include salt, pepper, or other spices based on customer preferences.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Proper seasoning enhances the flavor of the fish. Be careful not to overdo it, as too much seasoning can overpower the natural taste of the fish.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Grill the Fish:</h3>
        <p>Keep an eye on the grill as the fish cooks. You need to control the grilling time precisely to ensure the fish is cooked through but not overdone. The fish should develop a golden, crispy exterior and a moist, tender interior.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you see the fish turning golden or slightly bubbling, it's time to check it. Don't wait too long, as overcooked fish will lose its delicate texture.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Serve the Fish:</h3>
        <p>Once the fish is grilled to perfection, take it off the grill and place it on a plate. Optionally, you can add garnishes like lemon wedges, herbs, or a side dish to enhance the presentation.</p>
        <p>Serve the dish promptly to the customer to avoid lowering their satisfaction due to long waiting times.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips">Tips & Tricks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Mastering Grill Time:</strong> The key to grilling fish in Cookingdom is perfect timing. If you leave the fish on the grill too long, it will become dry and overcooked. If it's undercooked, it'll be too raw. Watch for the golden-brown color and bubbling edges to know when the fish is ready.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Efficient Order Management:</strong> As the game progresses, more customers will come in, and it's crucial to manage their orders efficiently. Prioritize orders based on their waiting times and prep ingredients ahead of time to save time during high-demand periods.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Upgrading Kitchen Equipment:</strong> As you progress in Cookingdom, you can unlock new kitchen equipment. Upgrading your grill or other cooking devices will help you cook faster and more efficiently, which is essential for managing more customers and their orders.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Use Boosters and Speedups:</strong> In some levels, you can use boosters or speed-up items to cook the fish faster or prepare other ingredients. These tools can be lifesavers when you're dealing with a large number of orders at once.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Customer Satisfaction:</strong> Remember that Cookingdom is all about satisfying your customers. The quicker you serve them with well-prepared food, the better your scores. Timely service and perfect dishes will keep your customers happy and your rating high.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Level 5 in Cookingdom introduces the challenge of grilling fish. The key to success is controlling the grill's temperature and timing to ensure the fish is perfectly cooked. Managing multiple orders, upgrading kitchen equipment, and using boosters will help you complete the level successfully.</p>
<p>Once you finish this level, you'll unlock more kitchen upgrades and new recipes that will take your culinary skills to the next level. Keep refining your cooking and time-management skills to stay ahead of the game!</p>

<h2 id="overview">Game Overview</h2>
<p>In Cookingdom, each level introduces new challenges and recipes to master. In Level 6, you'll face the task of preparing a Café Espresso, a crucial skill for expanding your café offerings and increasing customer satisfaction. This level is focused on learning how to brew the perfect espresso shot, a key element of coffee-based beverages that will appear more frequently as you progress through the game.</p>
<p>As you move through this level, you'll also begin to deal with more complex customer orders and need to handle multiple drinks simultaneously. It's time to sharpen your time management skills and improve your efficiency in the kitchen!</p>

<h2 id="goal">Level 6 Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Prepare Café Espresso:</strong> In this level, you will focus on making the perfect espresso. The process is relatively simple but requires precision to get the balance right. You will need to use the coffee machine, control the grind of the beans, and ensure the right amount of water flows through.</li>
    <li><strong>Manage Multiple Orders:</strong> As customers begin to order coffee and espresso, you must keep track of multiple drinks simultaneously. This involves preparing different beverages while ensuring the quality of each.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve with Precision and Speed:</strong> Since espresso shots require a short brewing time, you must serve them quickly. Keeping an eye on multiple orders at once and serving each one promptly will be crucial for maximizing customer satisfaction.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Steps to Make Café Espresso</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Grind the Coffee Beans:</h3>
        <p>The first step in making a great Café Espresso is selecting and grinding the right coffee beans. In Cookingdom, the coffee grinder will be available for use. Make sure to adjust the grind size properly, as the espresso requires a finer grind than other coffee drinks.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the grind is too coarse, the espresso will be weak. If it's too fine, the coffee might taste bitter.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Prepare the Espresso Machine:</h3>
        <p>Once the coffee beans are ground, place the grounds into the portafilter of the espresso machine. Ensure the grounds are evenly distributed and tamped down to avoid uneven extraction.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> A well-packed portafilter ensures a uniform extraction, which is crucial for a balanced espresso shot.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Brew the Espresso:</h3>
        <p>Place the portafilter in the espresso machine and start the brewing process. The machine will force hot water through the finely ground coffee, creating a rich and aromatic espresso shot.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Pay attention to the brewing time. Typically, a shot of espresso takes about 25-30 seconds to brew. The espresso should have a rich crema (golden foam) on top.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Serve the Espresso:</h3>
        <p>Once brewed, serve the espresso in a small cup. In Cookingdom, you might have the option to add a garnish, like a sugar cube or a cinnamon stick, but traditionally, espresso is served plain.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Speed is crucial! Since espresso is a quick drink to prepare, make sure to serve it promptly to avoid keeping customers waiting.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips">Tips & Tricks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Control the Grind:</strong> The grind of your coffee beans will have a significant impact on the flavor of your espresso. Ensure the grind is fine enough for a proper extraction but not so fine that the water can't flow through it. A balanced grind will ensure a rich and flavorful espresso shot.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Time the Brewing Process:</strong> Espresso brewing time is typically between 25-30 seconds. If the brewing process is too quick, your espresso might taste watery or under-extracted. If it's too slow, it may be over-extracted and bitter. Timing is key to perfecting your espresso.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Keep Track of Multiple Orders:</strong> As more customers start arriving, you will have multiple orders to manage. Cookingdom will challenge you with simultaneous orders for different drinks, so be prepared to juggle multiple tasks at once. Prioritize orders based on customer patience and the complexity of the drink.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Upgrade Your Coffee Equipment:</strong> As you progress through Cookingdom, upgrading your espresso machine or grinder will increase your efficiency and improve the quality of your espresso shots. Investing in better equipment can help you handle more orders in less time.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Serve Quickly to Maximize Satisfaction:</strong> Customers in Cookingdom get impatient if they have to wait too long for their order. Since espresso is a quick drink to prepare, you should serve it as soon as it's ready to keep your customers happy and boost your ratings.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In Level 6 of Cookingdom, making the perfect Café Espresso is all about controlling the coffee grind, brewing time, and serving quickly. With more customers ordering drinks, you'll need to efficiently manage your time, multitask, and prioritize orders to ensure a smooth operation. Mastering espresso will unlock a variety of coffee drinks and challenges that will appear in future levels.</p>
<p>This level serves as a great introduction to more advanced coffee-based recipes, preparing you for the increasingly complex orders that await in later stages of the game. By the end of this level, you'll have a solid understanding of coffee preparation and be ready to handle more advanced cooking and drink-making techniques.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Game Overview</h2>
<p>In Cookingdom, each level introduces new cooking challenges and recipes that test your culinary skills and time management. Level 7 focuses on preparing Sunny Eggs, a simple yet delicate dish that requires precision to ensure the egg yolk remains intact while cooking. As you advance through Cookingdom, you'll need to master this dish to meet the growing demands of your customers, who will expect perfect sunny-side-up eggs.</p>
<p>This level introduces more complex multitasking as you juggle multiple orders, but don't worry — with the right approach, you can handle it. Let's dive into the steps to make the perfect sunny eggs!</p>

<h2 id="goal">Level 7 Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cook Sunny Eggs:</strong> In Cookingdom, sunny eggs are a classic breakfast dish. The goal of this level is to prepare the eggs perfectly with the yolk intact while avoiding overcooking the whites. Cooking the eggs to the perfect level of doneness will be the key to success in this level.</li>
    <li><strong>Manage Multiple Orders Efficiently:</strong> As in previous levels, you will need to handle multiple orders at once. In this level, sunny eggs will be a popular item on the menu, so you need to keep track of the time and serve each dish on time.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve Quickly and Precisely:</strong> Cookingdom customers are impatient, and they expect their sunny eggs to be cooked just right. Overcooking the eggs or serving them too late will lower your score, so timing and efficiency are essential.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Steps to Make Sunny Eggs</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Prepare the Pan:</h3>
        <p>To cook sunny eggs, start by heating the pan. Once the pan is hot, add a small amount of oil or butter to prevent the eggs from sticking. Make sure the oil is evenly spread across the pan surface.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> A non-stick pan is best for sunny eggs to avoid breaking the yolk.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Crack the Eggs:</h3>
        <p>Carefully crack the eggs and place them into the pan. Be sure to avoid breaking the yolk. Cookingdom will give you the option to crack the eggs one at a time, so be patient and make sure the yolk stays intact as you place each egg in the pan.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you're cooking multiple eggs, be sure they're spaced far enough apart to avoid them touching and sticking together.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Cook the Eggs:</h3>
        <p>Let the eggs cook on medium heat for a few minutes until the whites are fully set and the yolk is still runny. The key here is to cook the whites completely without overcooking the yolk. The eggs should have a soft, golden yolk in the center.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't flip the eggs! Sunny eggs are meant to be cooked on one side only, and flipping can cause the yolk to break.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Serve the Sunny Eggs:</h3>
        <p>Once the eggs are cooked to perfection, carefully slide them onto a plate. In Cookingdom, you can garnish the eggs with herbs or serve them with a side, depending on the customer's order.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Serve the eggs immediately to keep them fresh and avoid customer dissatisfaction due to long waiting times.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips">Tips & Tricks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Monitor Heat Carefully:</strong> In Cookingdom, controlling the heat is key to making perfect sunny eggs. If the heat is too high, the eggs may cook too fast and cause the whites to burn before the yolk is done. Keep the heat at a moderate level to ensure a nice golden yolk with fully cooked whites.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Don't Rush:</strong> Although the eggs seem simple to make, rushing through the process can result in broken yolks or overcooked eggs. Take your time and focus on cooking the eggs just right. Customers in Cookingdom are picky about the quality of their food.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Multitasking:</strong> Cookingdom will test your multitasking skills, as you'll often need to prepare sunny eggs while other orders are also waiting. Be sure to prioritize orders based on time and complexity, and don't forget to check on the eggs regularly while working on other dishes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Use Boosters for Efficiency:</strong> As you progress through Cookingdom, you'll unlock boosters and speed-ups that can help you cook faster or improve your efficiency. Using these tools strategically can help you complete orders on time, especially when multiple customers are ordering sunny eggs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Customer Satisfaction:</strong> Cookingdom is all about satisfying your customers. If your eggs are perfectly cooked and served promptly, you'll earn high ratings. Always aim to serve the eggs as soon as they're ready to avoid disappointing your customers.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Level 7 in Cookingdom is all about perfecting the art of cooking sunny eggs. The key to success is controlling the heat, cooking the eggs just right without overcooking them, and serving them as soon as they're ready. Time management and multitasking are crucial as you prepare sunny eggs along with other dishes.</p>
<p>With the right technique and quick service, you'll easily complete this level and keep your customers happy. As you advance through Cookingdom, you'll encounter more complex recipes and customer orders, so mastering the basics of sunny eggs will set you up for future success.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Texas BBQ Walkthrough</h2>

<h3>Step 1. Gather the Boar Meat (Mini-game)</h3>
<p>
  In the outdoor scene, wait for the **rabbit** to appear with a **carrot**.
  Drag the **carrot** to the **boar** hiding in the bush. The boar eats it and
  runs off, leaving the meat ingredient.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Be ready to drag the carrot as soon as the rabbit
  brings it.
</p>

<h3>Step 2. Prepare the Ribs</h3>
<p>
  Place the **rib rack** on the **cutting board**. Drag the **paper towel**
  over the three highlighted spots to pat dry. Select the **knife** and cut
  vertically between the bones, following the guides (3 cuts). Sprinkle the
  **red seasoning**, then the **salt shaker** over the ribs.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Ensure all spots are dried and cuts are precise.
  Season evenly.
</p>

<h3>Step 3. Prepare Aromatics</h3>
<p>
  Place the **garlic bulb** on the empty cutting board. Tap repeatedly to
  separate cloves. Select the **knife** and tap the cloves to mince. Move
  garlic aside. Place **spring onions** on the board. Select the **knife** and
  tap to chop both the white and green parts.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Repeated tapping speeds up mincing and chopping.
</p>

<h3>Step 4. Cook the BBQ Sauce</h3>
<p>
  Turn on the **induction cooktop**. Place the **pan** on it. Add **butter**
  and let it melt. Add **minced garlic** and sauté briefly. Use the **spoon**
  to add **sugar** from its bowl; stir. Use the spoon to add the **red sauce
  base; stir. Add **chopped spring onions** and stir until the sauce simmers.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Add ingredients in the correct order and stir after
  each addition.
</p>

<h3>Step 5. Grill the Ribs</h3>
<p>
  Place the **grill plate** on the cooktop. Place the seasoned **ribs** onto
  the hot grill. Use the **spoon** to take **BBQ sauce** from the bowl and
  repeatedly drag it over the ribs to baste them as they cook.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Ensure all ribs are thoroughly basted multiple times
  for a good glaze. Wait for the heart confirmation.
</p>

<h3>Step 6. Plate the Texas BBQ</h3>
<p>
  On the empty plate, first add the **salad mix**. Use the **spoon** to add
  **dressing** to the salad. Place the **grilled ribs** next to the salad. Add
  the **fried egg** beside the ribs. Finally, use the **spoon** to drizzle more
  **BBQ sauce** over the ribs.
</p>
<p>
  💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Arrange the components neatly as shown in the final
  dish image for best presentation.
</p>

<h2>Spaghetti Mastery: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

<h3>Step 1. Get the Water Boiling & Season It</h3>
<p>
  First, activate the **hot plate**. Pour the **water** from its bowl into the
  **pot**. Once you see vigorous boiling (lots of bubbles!), add **salt** from
  its container.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't rush! Make sure the water is at a rolling
  boil before adding salt or pasta. That's key for proper cooking.
</div>

<h3>Step 2. Cook Your Spaghetti to Al Dente</h3>
<p>
  Now, gently place the **dry spaghetti strands** into the boiling, salted
  water. Wait patiently until the pasta is fully cooked.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The spaghetti will soften and settle on its own.
  Keep an eye out for a sparkle animation – that's your cue that it's perfectly
  cooked!
</div>

<h3>Step 3. Drain the Cooked Spaghetti</h3>
<p>
  Grab your **spider strainer tool**. Carefully lift the cooked spaghetti from
  the pot and transfer it directly into the designated **serving bowl**.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ensure you get every last strand out of the pot!
</div>

<h3>Step 4. Precisely Dice the Tomatoes</h3>
<p>
  Move the **whole tomatoes** onto the **cutting board**. Select your **knife**
  and follow the on-screen guides to first slice and then dice the tomatoes. Put
  the diced tomatoes back into their bowl.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Accurate dicing according to the game's guides
  is super important for a high score. Take your time here!
</div>

<h3>Step 5. Dice the Onion with Care</h3>
<p>
  Place the **onion** onto the **cutting board**. Use your **knife tool**,
  following the on-screen guides, to slice and then dice the onion. Return the
  diced onion to its bowl.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Good knife work here means your ingredients will
  cook evenly later on.
</div>

<h3>Step 6. Begin Your Bolognese Sauce</h3>
<p>
  Place a clean **pot** onto the **hot plate**. Add the **oil/butter** from its
  bowl. Sprinkle in some **pepper** from the shaker. Then, add your previously
  diced **tomatoes and onions** to the pot.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Let the oil or butter warm up a bit before
  tossing in the vegetables.
</div>

<h3>Step 7. Sauté Veggies and Cook the Meat</h3>
<p>
  Use the **ladle** to stir the tomatoes and onions in the pot. Now, add the
  **ground meat**. Keep stirring, breaking up the meat as you go, until it
  changes color and is fully cooked through.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Stir frequently! This prevents sticking and
  ensures your meat cooks evenly.
</div>

<h3>Step 8. Simmer the Rich Sauce</h3>
<p>
  Pour the **tomato sauce base** from the jar into the pot with your cooked
  meat and vegetables. Stir everything thoroughly with the **ladle** to combine
  all the ingredients. Let the sauce simmer until it's ready.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The sauce will thicken slightly as it simmers. A
  sparkle animation will confirm when it's perfectly done!
</div>

<h3>Step 9. Plate Your Spaghetti and Sauce</h3>
<p>
  With your cooked spaghetti already in the serving bowl, use the **ladle** to
  spoon a generous amount of your freshly made **Bolognese sauce** over the
  pasta.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Make sure your delicious sauce covers the
  spaghetti well.
</div>

<h3>Step 10. Garnish for a Masterpiece</h3>
<p>
  Carefully arrange the **sliced tomato garnishes** around the outer edge of
  the pasta. Add a dollop of the **cream sauce topping** right in the center.
  Sprinkle the **shredded cheese** over the Bolognese sauce. Finally, place the
  fresh **basil leaves** right on top as the finishing touch.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Exact placement for each garnish, following the
  visual guides, is essential for that coveted 3-star 'Taste explosion!' rating.
</div>

<h2>Salmon Sushi Mastery: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

<h3>Step 1. The Fishing Mini-Game</h3>
<p>
  Dive into the underwater scene as the capybara chef. Your goal is to collect
  **5 fish** of any variety by swimming into them. Be careful to **avoid all
  trash items** like plastic bottles, glass bottles, and cans. Once you've
  caught all 5 fish, they'll automatically transfer to your boat.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Strategize your swimming path to grab fish
  efficiently while expertly dodging any debris.
</div>

<h3>Step 2. Perfectly Cook Your Rice</h3>
<p>
  Place the bowl of **rice** into the metal **pot**. Move the pot to the **sink
  faucet** and add enough **water** to cover the rice for washing. Next,
  transfer the pot (with rice and water) into the **rice cooker**. Close the
  lid. The cooker will begin automatically, indicated by a light and steam.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't forget to add water to the rice *before*
  placing the pot in the cooker for proper washing and cooking.
</div>

<h3>Step 3. Prepare the Carrot</h3>
<p>
  Place the **carrot** on the **cutting board**. Use the **peeler tool** to
  remove all the skin, then discard the peels. Switch to your **knife tool**
  and follow the on-screen guides to slice the carrot into long, thin strips
  (julienne style). Finally, place the cut carrot into a **container**.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ensure the carrot is thoroughly peeled before
  making precise cuts along the guide lines.
</div>

<h3>Step 4. Prepare the Avocado</h3>
<p>
  Place the **avocado** on the **cutting board**. Use your **knife** to cut it
  (the pit will be removed automatically). Then, use the **knife again** (it
  acts as a peeler here) to carefully remove the skin from the avocado halves.
  Discard the skin. Follow the guides with your knife to slice the avocado
  flesh thinly. Place the slices into a **container**.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The game uses the knife for peeling here, so just
  follow the prompts carefully!
</div>

<h3>Step 5. Prepare the Cucumber</h3>
<p>
  Place the **cucumber** on the **cutting board**. Use your **knife** (again,
  acting as a peeler) to remove the skin, then discard it. Switch back to your
  **knife tool** and follow the guides to cut the cucumber into thin, long
  strips (julienne). Place the cut cucumber into a **container**.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Make sure all the skin is removed before you
  start cutting your cucumber into strips.
</div>

<h3>Step 6. Prepare the Salmon Strips</h3>
<p>
  Place the **pre-sliced salmon** onto the **cutting board**. Use your **knife
  tool** and follow the guides to cut these slices into even thinner strips,
  perfect for your sushi filling. Place the salmon strips into a **container**.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Cut precisely along the lines to achieve uniform
  salmon strips for your rolls.
</div>

<h3>Step 7. Retrieve Your Cooked Rice</h3>
<p>
  Open the **rice cooker lid** and take out the pot containing the perfectly
  cooked rice. Place the pot on the preparation counter.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The rice should be steaming, indicating it's
  cooked to perfection and ready for rolling.
</div>

<h3>Step 8. Roll Your Sushi (Three Times!)</h3>
<p>
  Place one sheet of **Nori** on the **bamboo rolling mat**. Take a portion of
  your cooked **rice** and spread it evenly over the Nori, remembering to leave
  a small gap at the far edge. You can optionally spread a thin line of
  **wasabi** horizontally across the rice. Layer your prepared strips of
  **cucumber, carrot, avocado, and salmon** horizontally on the rice, closer to
  the bottom edge. Carefully lift the edge of the mat and roll the Nori and
  ingredients tightly into a cylinder. Place the finished roll aside in a
  **container**. You'll need to **repeat this entire process to make a total of
  three rolls**.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Spread the rice thinly and evenly. Roll firmly
  using the mat to ensure a compact, well-formed roll that won't fall apart.
</div>

<h3>Step 9. Expertly Cut Your Sushi Rolls</h3>
<p>
  Place one finished sushi roll onto a **clean cutting board**. Use your
  **knife** and follow the cutting guides to slice the roll into several (it
  will be 4) equal pieces. Repeat this for your other two rolls.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use sharp, decisive cuts for clean edges. Aim for
  uniform thickness across all your sushi pieces.
</div>

<h3>Step 10. Masterful Sushi Plating</h3>
<p>
  Arrange your cut sushi pieces neatly on the **black serving platter** (you
  should have 12 pieces in total). Place a prepared dollop of **wasabi** onto
  the platter. Next, place a portion of **pickled ginger (gari)** onto the
  platter. Finally, add the sprig of **parsley/garnish** for a decorative
  finish.
</p>
<div class="tip">
  💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Arrange the sushi pieces attractively and place
  the condiments and garnish exactly as shown in the final dish image.
</div>
