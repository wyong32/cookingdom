    detailsHtml: `<h2>Game Introduction</h2>
<p>In Level 1 of Cookingdom, players learn how to make and serve pizza, one of the most basic dishes in the game. This level focuses on familiarizing players with the cooking process, ingredient preparation, and the basic rhythm of restaurant operation.</p>
<h2>Level 1 Goal</h2>
<p>You will be required to make and serve the first pizza to a customer. Making pizza involves several steps, including preparing ingredients, baking, and serving. The goal is to satisfy customer needs quickly and accurately to complete the task.</p>
<h2>Pizza Making Process</h2>
<h3>Prepare Pizza Ingredients:</h3>
<p>First, gather the basic ingredients: pizza base, tomato sauce, cheese, and other toppings (like sausage, mushrooms).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pizza Base:</strong> Grab a pizza base from the ingredient area.</li>
  <li><strong>Tomato Sauce:</strong> Spread tomato sauce evenly on the base.</li>
  <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Sprinkle cheese, ensuring even coverage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Add Toppings:</h3>
<p>In Level 1, toppings are simple. Use basic ones like sausage or mushrooms.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drag toppings onto the pizza, ensuring even distribution. This enhances flavor and customer satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bake the Pizza:</h3>
<p>Place the prepared pizza into the oven.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Baking time is crucial. Overbaking burns the pizza; underbaking leaves it raw.</p>
<p>Monitor the pizza's progress closely during baking to ensure perfect color and texture.</p>
<h3>Check Pizza Doneness:</h3>
<p>Observe the pizza's appearance. When it turns golden brown and smells fragrant, it's ready.</p>
<p>Overbaked pizza becomes charred and tastes bad, potentially dissatisfying customers.</p>
<h3>Serve the Pizza:</h3>
<p>Remove the baked pizza from the oven and immediately deliver it to the customer's table.</p>
<p>Timing is important: Long waits decrease customer satisfaction, affecting your score and rewards.</p>
<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Learn to manage time, especially with cooking and prep. Precise oven control is needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Prepare Ingredients in Advance:</strong> While waiting for the pizza to bake, prepare other ingredients or clean the kitchen. Prep ahead for faster serving.</li>
  <li><strong>Oven Operation:</strong> Familiarize yourself with the oven. Each food has different baking times; master them.</li>
  <li><strong>Customer Patience:</strong> Long waits decrease patience and scores. Speed up service.</li>
  <li><strong>Practice Multitasking:</strong> While baking, prep other items or clean to improve efficiency. Later levels have more customers and dishes, so practice helps.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Making the first pizza is an introductory task in Cookingdom. It familiarizes you with cooking and serving basics, ingredient management, cooking time control, and customer needs. The goal is to understand basic time management and preparation skills for more complex levels ahead.</p>
<p>Completing Level 1 grants coins and score rewards, unlocking more kitchen equipment and recipes for a richer game experience.</p>`,

    detailsHtml: `<h2>Game Introduction</h2>
<p>In Level 2, players learn to make Fried Potatoes. While relatively simple, it requires more time management and detailed operation, especially with complex customer demands. This level introduces the frying process, teaching players to use kitchen equipment to speed up cooking and serve delicious fries.</p>
<h2>Level 2 Goal</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Make Fried Potatoes:</strong> Master the correct frying process using the fryer, even though it lacks the complex steps of an oven.</li>
  <li><strong>Handle Multiple Customers:</strong> Expect more customers than in previous levels, requiring quick handling of multiple orders and efficient service.</li>
  <li><strong>Improve Kitchen Efficiency:</strong> Learn to use kitchen equipment effectively, like prepping potatoes quickly and speeding up frying.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fried Potato Making Steps</h2>
<h3>Prepare Potatoes:</h3>
<p>Take potatoes from the ingredient area and cut them into strips. You can choose to prep them in advance or when an order comes in.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Prepping potatoes ahead reduces customer wait time, especially with multiple simultaneous arrivals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fry Potatoes:</h3>
<p>Place the cut potato strips into the fryer. Control the frying time to ensure they are crispy outside and soft inside.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Observe the potatoes' change during frying to avoid over-frying (making them burnt or greasy).</li>
  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Potatoes are usually ready when they turn golden brown and float to the surface; remove them promptly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Add Seasoning:</h3>
<p>After frying, add extra seasonings like salt or pepper to enhance flavor and customer satisfaction.</p>
<h3>Serve to Customer:</h3>
<p>Deliver the finished fried potatoes immediately. Though relatively quick to make, timely service is still needed to prevent long waits.</p>
<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Prepare Ingredients in Advance:</strong> With potentially frequent customer demands, prepping potato strips and the fryer is key to efficiency. Prepping saves significant time, especially with multiple waiting customers.</li>
  <li><strong>Master Frying Time:</strong> Keep frying time within the right range. Too long makes potatoes greasy or burnt; too short makes them not crispy enough. Watch their appearance and changes in the fryer.</li>
  <li><strong>Utilize Kitchen Equipment:</strong> You might unlock boosters or equipment like a rapid fryer. Use these to speed up cooking during peak times.</li>
  <li><strong>Prioritize Customer Orders:</strong> Multiple customers might arrive simultaneously. Prioritize those waiting longer to ensure they get their food quickly.</li>
  <li><strong>Serve Quickly:</strong> Maintain efficient service to minimize wait times. Since fries are quick, use the time saved to prep the next dish or clean the kitchen.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Level 3's fried potato making is simple but demands efficient kitchen management and time control. You'll learn to operate frying equipment and handle multiple customer needs. As the game progresses, facing more diverse dishes and complex tasks, improving kitchen efficiency is crucial for success.</p>
<p>Completing Level 3 unlocks more recipes and equipment, preparing you for higher difficulty levels.</p>`,

    detailsHtml: `<h2>Game Introduction</h2>
<p>Level 3 introduces players to the fun of making Rolled Ice Cream. This dessert requires more precision and timing, and teaches players how to use freezing plates, control consistency, and decorate with toppings.</p>
<h2>Level 3 Goal</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Master the Roll:</strong> Pour and freeze the ice cream base, then roll it with precision to make visually appealing desserts.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Toppings Creatively:</strong> Add fruit, candy, or sauces to increase customer satisfaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Time and Sequence:</strong> Manage the freezing and rolling process efficiently to avoid delays.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rolled Ice Cream Making Steps</h2>
<h3>Prepare the Base:</h3>
<p>Select the right ice cream base from the ingredient area. Pour it evenly onto the cold plate for freezing.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Spread the mixture thin for faster freezing and easier rolling.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Freeze and Roll:</h3>
<p>Let the base freeze on the plate. Use the spatula to scrape and roll the frozen layer into curls.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Watch carefully—start rolling once the base is firm but not rock solid.</li>
  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Smooth, even rolling boosts customer ratings and makes serving quicker.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Add Toppings:</h3>
<p>Choose from toppings like strawberries, chocolate syrup, or sprinkles. Add them quickly before serving.</p>
<h3>Serve to Customer:</h3>
<p>Deliver the decorated ice cream rolls immediately. Presentation and speed affect satisfaction scores.</p>
<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Work in Batches:</strong> Prepare multiple bases and freeze in sequence to keep production steady during rushes.</li>
  <li><strong>Watch the Freezing:</strong> Timing is critical. If the base is under-frozen, it won’t roll well; if over-frozen, it’s hard to shape.</li>
  <li><strong>Decorate Fast:</strong> Have toppings ready to add right after rolling. This minimizes time and maximizes customer delight.</li>
  <li><strong>Upgrade Equipment:</strong> Unlock faster freezers or better spatulas to reduce effort and speed up the process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Cookingdom Level 3 elevates the gameplay with the unique technique of making rolled ice cream. You’ll learn to balance freezing time, rolling skills, and toppings to craft the perfect treat. With practice, you’ll be able to serve quickly and beautifully under time pressure. Get ready for more advanced dishes in future levels!</p>`,

<p>Level 4 introduces players to a refreshing and healthy dish: the Simple Salad. While it seems easy, the challenge lies in the fast-paced order processing and ingredient preparation. Precision, speed, and multitasking are key to success here.</p>
<h2>Level 4 Goal</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Chop and Mix:</strong> Accurately prepare salad ingredients by chopping vegetables and mixing them in the correct order.</li>
  <li><strong>Serve Quickly:</strong> Customers expect quick service; maintain a steady workflow to avoid delays.</li>
  <li><strong>Manage Freshness:</strong> Don’t leave ingredients out too long or they may spoil or be rejected by picky customers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Simple Salad Making Steps</h2>
<h3>Gather Ingredients:</h3>
<p>Collect the vegetables: lettuce, tomato, and cucumber. Ingredients are placed in the ingredient station—tap them to bring them to the prep board.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Always keep a few of each ingredient prepped during idle moments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chop Vegetables:</h3>
<p>Use the knife tool to chop ingredients. Precision is key—chop too slowly, and customers will wait. Chop too fast, and you may make mistakes.</p>
<h3>Mix and Assemble:</h3>
<p>Place the chopped vegetables into the salad bowl in the right order. Some customers may request specific ingredient combinations.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Pay attention to order bubbles showing customer preferences.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Serve to Customer:</h3>
<p>Deliver the salad quickly after assembling. If served late, customer satisfaction will decrease.</p>
<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pre-Chop Common Veggies:</strong> Lettuce and tomato appear in most orders, so having them ready reduces service time.</li>
  <li><strong>Watch the Order Queue:</strong> Prepare for the next order while assembling the current one. This helps maintain a flow during peak times.</li>
  <li><strong>Upgrade Tools:</strong> Unlock a faster knife or an automatic chopper to increase your speed and accuracy.</li>
  <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Juggling orders and freshness is crucial. Don't overstock chopped ingredients to avoid waste.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Cookingdom Level 4 is all about speed and accuracy. Making a Simple Salad might be basic, but with fast-paced orders and specific requests, you’ll need to manage ingredients, prep time, and service flow efficiently. Get ready for more challenging dishes in the next levels!</p>`,

<h2 id="overview">Game Overview</h2>
<p>In Cookingdom, each level introduces a new cooking challenge, and in Level 5, players are tasked with preparing Grilled Fish. Compared to the previous levels, grilling fish requires careful attention to timing and heat control. You will need to master grilling techniques, ensure the fish is cooked just right, and serve your customers promptly to keep them happy.</p>
<p>As you progress in Cookingdom, new skills are unlocked, and with each new level, you'll encounter more complex recipes and customer demands. This level introduces grilling as a key technique and will test your ability to manage time efficiently in the kitchen.</p>

<h2 id="goal">Level 5 Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cook Grilled Fish:</strong> In this level, you'll learn how to grill fish to perfection. Cookingdom gives you the necessary tools to control the grill's temperature, but you must monitor the fish closely to ensure it doesn't burn or undercook. The goal is to grill the fish evenly and achieve the right texture and flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Control the Heat:</strong> Grilling fish requires precise control of heat. You need to grill the fish just long enough for it to develop a crispy, golden exterior while keeping the inside tender and moist. Overcooking or undercooking will result in unhappy customers.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficiently Serve Customers:</strong> As more customers start to arrive, you'll need to handle multiple orders at once. Cookingdom will test your ability to manage time and prioritize orders while ensuring each dish is prepared perfectly.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Steps to Make Grilled Fish</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Prepare the Fish:</h3>
        <p>First, take the fish from the ingredients area and place it on the grill. In Cookingdom, there may be different types of fish available, so make sure to select the right one based on customer requests.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the customer specifies a certain type of fish, prepare it quickly to avoid delays.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Season the Fish:</h3>
        <p>Once the fish is placed on the grill, add the appropriate seasoning. Common seasonings include salt, pepper, or other spices based on customer preferences.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Proper seasoning enhances the flavor of the fish. Be careful not to overdo it, as too much seasoning can overpower the natural taste of the fish.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Grill the Fish:</h3>
        <p>Keep an eye on the grill as the fish cooks. You need to control the grilling time precisely to ensure the fish is cooked through but not overdone. The fish should develop a golden, crispy exterior and a moist, tender interior.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you see the fish turning golden or slightly bubbling, it's time to check it. Don't wait too long, as overcooked fish will lose its delicate texture.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Serve the Fish:</h3>
        <p>Once the fish is grilled to perfection, take it off the grill and place it on a plate. Optionally, you can add garnishes like lemon wedges, herbs, or a side dish to enhance the presentation.</p>
        <p>Serve the dish promptly to the customer to avoid lowering their satisfaction due to long waiting times.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips">Tips & Tricks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Mastering Grill Time:</strong> The key to grilling fish in Cookingdom is perfect timing. If you leave the fish on the grill too long, it will become dry and overcooked. If it's undercooked, it'll be too raw. Watch for the golden-brown color and bubbling edges to know when the fish is ready.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Efficient Order Management:</strong> As the game progresses, more customers will come in, and it's crucial to manage their orders efficiently. Prioritize orders based on their waiting times and prep ingredients ahead of time to save time during high-demand periods.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Upgrading Kitchen Equipment:</strong> As you progress in Cookingdom, you can unlock new kitchen equipment. Upgrading your grill or other cooking devices will help you cook faster and more efficiently, which is essential for managing more customers and their orders.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Use Boosters and Speedups:</strong> In some levels, you can use boosters or speed-up items to cook the fish faster or prepare other ingredients. These tools can be lifesavers when you're dealing with a large number of orders at once.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Customer Satisfaction:</strong> Remember that Cookingdom is all about satisfying your customers. The quicker you serve them with well-prepared food, the better your scores. Timely service and perfect dishes will keep your customers happy and your rating high.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Level 5 in Cookingdom introduces the challenge of grilling fish. The key to success is controlling the grill's temperature and timing to ensure the fish is perfectly cooked. Managing multiple orders, upgrading kitchen equipment, and using boosters will help you complete the level successfully.</p>
<p>Once you finish this level, you'll unlock more kitchen upgrades and new recipes that will take your culinary skills to the next level. Keep refining your cooking and time-management skills to stay ahead of the game!</p>

<h2 id="overview">Game Overview</h2>
<p>In Cookingdom, each level introduces new challenges and recipes to master. In Level 6, you'll face the task of preparing a Café Espresso, a crucial skill for expanding your café offerings and increasing customer satisfaction. This level is focused on learning how to brew the perfect espresso shot, a key element of coffee-based beverages that will appear more frequently as you progress through the game.</p>
<p>As you move through this level, you'll also begin to deal with more complex customer orders and need to handle multiple drinks simultaneously. It's time to sharpen your time management skills and improve your efficiency in the kitchen!</p>

<h2 id="goal">Level 6 Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Prepare Café Espresso:</strong> In this level, you will focus on making the perfect espresso. The process is relatively simple but requires precision to get the balance right. You will need to use the coffee machine, control the grind of the beans, and ensure the right amount of water flows through.</li>
    <li><strong>Manage Multiple Orders:</strong> As customers begin to order coffee and espresso, you must keep track of multiple drinks simultaneously. This involves preparing different beverages while ensuring the quality of each.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve with Precision and Speed:</strong> Since espresso shots require a short brewing time, you must serve them quickly. Keeping an eye on multiple orders at once and serving each one promptly will be crucial for maximizing customer satisfaction.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Steps to Make Café Espresso</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Grind the Coffee Beans:</h3>
        <p>The first step in making a great Café Espresso is selecting and grinding the right coffee beans. In Cookingdom, the coffee grinder will be available for use. Make sure to adjust the grind size properly, as the espresso requires a finer grind than other coffee drinks.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the grind is too coarse, the espresso will be weak. If it's too fine, the coffee might taste bitter.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Prepare the Espresso Machine:</h3>
        <p>Once the coffee beans are ground, place the grounds into the portafilter of the espresso machine. Ensure the grounds are evenly distributed and tamped down to avoid uneven extraction.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> A well-packed portafilter ensures a uniform extraction, which is crucial for a balanced espresso shot.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Brew the Espresso:</h3>
        <p>Place the portafilter in the espresso machine and start the brewing process. The machine will force hot water through the finely ground coffee, creating a rich and aromatic espresso shot.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Pay attention to the brewing time. Typically, a shot of espresso takes about 25-30 seconds to brew. The espresso should have a rich crema (golden foam) on top.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Serve the Espresso:</h3>
        <p>Once brewed, serve the espresso in a small cup. In Cookingdom, you might have the option to add a garnish, like a sugar cube or a cinnamon stick, but traditionally, espresso is served plain.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Speed is crucial! Since espresso is a quick drink to prepare, make sure to serve it promptly to avoid keeping customers waiting.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips">Tips & Tricks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Control the Grind:</strong> The grind of your coffee beans will have a significant impact on the flavor of your espresso. Ensure the grind is fine enough for a proper extraction but not so fine that the water can't flow through it. A balanced grind will ensure a rich and flavorful espresso shot.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Time the Brewing Process:</strong> Espresso brewing time is typically between 25-30 seconds. If the brewing process is too quick, your espresso might taste watery or under-extracted. If it's too slow, it may be over-extracted and bitter. Timing is key to perfecting your espresso.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Keep Track of Multiple Orders:</strong> As more customers start arriving, you will have multiple orders to manage. Cookingdom will challenge you with simultaneous orders for different drinks, so be prepared to juggle multiple tasks at once. Prioritize orders based on customer patience and the complexity of the drink.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Upgrade Your Coffee Equipment:</strong> As you progress through Cookingdom, upgrading your espresso machine or grinder will increase your efficiency and improve the quality of your espresso shots. Investing in better equipment can help you handle more orders in less time.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Serve Quickly to Maximize Satisfaction:</strong> Customers in Cookingdom get impatient if they have to wait too long for their order. Since espresso is a quick drink to prepare, you should serve it as soon as it's ready to keep your customers happy and boost your ratings.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In Level 6 of Cookingdom, making the perfect Café Espresso is all about controlling the coffee grind, brewing time, and serving quickly. With more customers ordering drinks, you'll need to efficiently manage your time, multitask, and prioritize orders to ensure a smooth operation. Mastering espresso will unlock a variety of coffee drinks and challenges that will appear in future levels.</p>
<p>This level serves as a great introduction to more advanced coffee-based recipes, preparing you for the increasingly complex orders that await in later stages of the game. By the end of this level, you'll have a solid understanding of coffee preparation and be ready to handle more advanced cooking and drink-making techniques.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Game Overview</h2>
<p>In Cookingdom, each level introduces new cooking challenges and recipes that test your culinary skills and time management. Level 7 focuses on preparing Sunny Eggs, a simple yet delicate dish that requires precision to ensure the egg yolk remains intact while cooking. As you advance through Cookingdom, you'll need to master this dish to meet the growing demands of your customers, who will expect perfect sunny-side-up eggs.</p>
<p>This level introduces more complex multitasking as you juggle multiple orders, but don't worry — with the right approach, you can handle it. Let's dive into the steps to make the perfect sunny eggs!</p>

<h2 id="goal">Level 7 Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cook Sunny Eggs:</strong> In Cookingdom, sunny eggs are a classic breakfast dish. The goal of this level is to prepare the eggs perfectly with the yolk intact while avoiding overcooking the whites. Cooking the eggs to the perfect level of doneness will be the key to success in this level.</li>
    <li><strong>Manage Multiple Orders Efficiently:</strong> As in previous levels, you will need to handle multiple orders at once. In this level, sunny eggs will be a popular item on the menu, so you need to keep track of the time and serve each dish on time.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve Quickly and Precisely:</strong> Cookingdom customers are impatient, and they expect their sunny eggs to be cooked just right. Overcooking the eggs or serving them too late will lower your score, so timing and efficiency are essential.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Steps to Make Sunny Eggs</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Prepare the Pan:</h3>
        <p>To cook sunny eggs, start by heating the pan. Once the pan is hot, add a small amount of oil or butter to prevent the eggs from sticking. Make sure the oil is evenly spread across the pan surface.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> A non-stick pan is best for sunny eggs to avoid breaking the yolk.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Crack the Eggs:</h3>
        <p>Carefully crack the eggs and place them into the pan. Be sure to avoid breaking the yolk. Cookingdom will give you the option to crack the eggs one at a time, so be patient and make sure the yolk stays intact as you place each egg in the pan.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you're cooking multiple eggs, be sure they're spaced far enough apart to avoid them touching and sticking together.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Cook the Eggs:</h3>
        <p>Let the eggs cook on medium heat for a few minutes until the whites are fully set and the yolk is still runny. The key here is to cook the whites completely without overcooking the yolk. The eggs should have a soft, golden yolk in the center.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't flip the eggs! Sunny eggs are meant to be cooked on one side only, and flipping can cause the yolk to break.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Serve the Sunny Eggs:</h3>
        <p>Once the eggs are cooked to perfection, carefully slide them onto a plate. In Cookingdom, you can garnish the eggs with herbs or serve them with a side, depending on the customer's order.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Serve the eggs immediately to keep them fresh and avoid customer dissatisfaction due to long waiting times.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips">Tips & Tricks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Monitor Heat Carefully:</strong> In Cookingdom, controlling the heat is key to making perfect sunny eggs. If the heat is too high, the eggs may cook too fast and cause the whites to burn before the yolk is done. Keep the heat at a moderate level to ensure a nice golden yolk with fully cooked whites.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Don't Rush:</strong> Although the eggs seem simple to make, rushing through the process can result in broken yolks or overcooked eggs. Take your time and focus on cooking the eggs just right. Customers in Cookingdom are picky about the quality of their food.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Multitasking:</strong> Cookingdom will test your multitasking skills, as you'll often need to prepare sunny eggs while other orders are also waiting. Be sure to prioritize orders based on time and complexity, and don't forget to check on the eggs regularly while working on other dishes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Use Boosters for Efficiency:</strong> As you progress through Cookingdom, you'll unlock boosters and speed-ups that can help you cook faster or improve your efficiency. Using these tools strategically can help you complete orders on time, especially when multiple customers are ordering sunny eggs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Customer Satisfaction:</strong> Cookingdom is all about satisfying your customers. If your eggs are perfectly cooked and served promptly, you'll earn high ratings. Always aim to serve the eggs as soon as they're ready to avoid disappointing your customers.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Level 7 in Cookingdom is all about perfecting the art of cooking sunny eggs. The key to success is controlling the heat, cooking the eggs just right without overcooking them, and serving them as soon as they're ready. Time management and multitasking are crucial as you prepare sunny eggs along with other dishes.</p>
<p>With the right technique and quick service, you'll easily complete this level and keep your customers happy. As you advance through Cookingdom, you'll encounter more complex recipes and customer orders, so mastering the basics of sunny eggs will set you up for future success.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Cookingdom Level 8 Game Overview</h2>
<p>In Cookingdom Level 8 brings the bold and flavorful Texas BBQ into the kitchen. This level challenges you to prepare a hearty, smoky BBQ meal with various meats, sauces, and sides.</p>
<p>At this level, you will be preparing BBQ meats like ribs or brisket, and pairing them with classic BBQ sides like cornbread, baked beans, and coleslaw. The challenge in Cookingdom Level 8 is balancing the cooking times of the meats and sides while ensuring everything is served hot and flavorful.</p>
<p>Let's dive into the details of Level 8 and master Texas BBQ!</p>

<h2 id="goal">Cookingdom Level 8 Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Cook the BBQ Meat (Ribs or Brisket):</strong> You'll need to cook the meat to perfection, making sure it's tender, juicy, and full of smoky flavor.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Prepare the BBQ Sauce:</strong> A good BBQ sauce is crucial for that authentic Texas flavor. You'll need to make sure the sauce is well-seasoned and paired perfectly with the meat.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cook the Sides:</strong> Texas BBQ is usually served with sides like cornbread, baked beans, and coleslaw. You'll need to keep these cooking while you manage the BBQ meats.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Serve Quickly:</strong> As always in Cookingdom Level 8 , serving your BBQ dishes hot and fresh is important for earning high ratings from customers. The faster you serve, the better your customer satisfaction.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Cookingdom Level 8 Steps to Make Texas BBQ</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Cook the BBQ Meat (Ribs or Brisket):</h3>
        <p>Start by seasoning your choice of meat (ribs or brisket) with a dry rub or marinade. In Cookingdom Level 8 , the seasoning will be provided for you, so your task is to apply it evenly to the meat.</p>
        <p>Once the meat is seasoned, place it in the smoker or grill. Cookingdom Level 8  uses a slow-cooking method, so this process can take time. Monitor the cooking to ensure the meat is tender and perfectly cooked.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Turn the meat regularly to ensure it cooks evenly on all sides. The ideal BBQ meat will be crispy on the outside, with a juicy and tender inside.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't overcook the meat! In Cookingdom Level 8 , keeping the meat just right will give it the best texture and flavor.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Cookingdom Level 8 Prepare the BBQ Sauce:</h3>
        <p>While the meat is cooking, focus on making the BBQ sauce. In Cookingdom Level 8 , the sauce is typically a blend of tangy, sweet, and smoky flavors, often with a base of ketchup or tomato sauce, vinegar, and brown sugar.</p>
        <p>You'll need to mix the ingredients together and cook them down into a thick, flavorful sauce. Once the sauce is ready, you'll apply it to the meat either during cooking or after the meat is plated.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't let the sauce burn! Stir it occasionally to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pot. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the meat without being too runny.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Cookingdom Level 8 Cook the Sides:</h3>
        <p>While you're focusing on the BBQ meat and sauce, don't forget about the sides! Texas BBQ is typically served with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cornbread:</strong> A slightly sweet, moist bread to complement the savory BBQ flavors.</li>
            <li><strong>Baked Beans:</strong> Slow-cooked beans in a rich sauce, often flavored with BBQ sauce or bacon.</li>
            <li><strong>Coleslaw:</strong> A cool, crunchy side to balance the richness of the BBQ.</li>
        </ul>

    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Cookingdom Level 8 Assemble the Dish:</h3>
        <p>Once the meat is cooked to perfection, and the sides are ready, it's time to plate the Texas BBQ. Start by placing the BBQ meat on the plate, then add generous portions of cornbread, baked beans, and coleslaw.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Cookingdom Level 8 Serve the Texas BBQ:</h3>
        <p>After assembling the dish, serve it quickly while everything is still hot. Cookingdom rewards speed, so the faster you serve, the higher your customer ratings will be.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't let the dish sit too long before serving — BBQ is best enjoyed fresh and hot. Make sure all the components are well-heated and ready to go.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips">Cookingdom Level 8 Tips & Tricks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Slow-Cook the Meat:</h3>
        <p>Texas BBQ requires slow-cooked meats, so be patient! The key is not to rush the cooking process. Monitor the grill or smoker carefully and avoid turning the heat up too high. A slow, steady cook is the key to tenderness.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Perfect BBQ Sauce:</h3>
        <p>The BBQ sauce is what really sets Texas BBQ apart. Make sure it's thick and flavorful, but not too sweet or tangy. Balance the flavors well, and stir frequently to avoid burning the sauce.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Multitask Efficiently:</h3>
        <p>Cookingdom Level 8  requires multitasking, so while the BBQ meat is cooking, keep an eye on the sides. Make sure the cornbread doesn't burn, the baked beans are simmering to the right consistency, and the coleslaw is fresh and crisp.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Serve Fresh and Hot:</h3>
        <p>The freshness of Texas BBQ is crucial to customer satisfaction. Serve the dish as soon as all the components are ready and hot. The longer the dish sits, the cooler it becomes, and the less appetizing it will be.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Upgrade Your Kitchen:</h3>
        <p>As you progress in Cookingdom Level 8 , consider upgrading your grill and other kitchen equipment to speed up the cooking process. A faster grill or smoker will help you keep up with the growing number of customers and reduce wait times.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In Level 8 of Cookingdom Level 8 , preparing Texas BBQ involves mastering the art of slow-cooking meats, perfecting the BBQ sauce, and balancing the sides like cornbread, baked beans, and coleslaw. Timing and multitasking are key to success, as you need to manage both the grilling of the meats and the preparation of the sides.</p>
<p>By focusing on perfecting the BBQ meat, creating a flavorful sauce, and managing your kitchen efficiently, you'll impress your customers and earn top ratings. The combination of tender BBQ, savory sides, and smoky flavor will keep your customers coming back for more.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Game Overview</h2>
<p>In Cookingdom, each level introduces new dishes and more challenging customers. In Level 9, your task is to prepare Spaghetti, a classic Italian dish that requires careful cooking and precise timing. Cooking the spaghetti and preparing the sauce is just the beginning. To keep your customers satisfied, you'll need to pay attention to the details, from the pasta's doneness to the choice of sauce and toppings.</p>
<p>As you advance in Cookingdom, you'll encounter more complex orders, and preparing spaghetti will test your multitasking and time-management skills. Let's walk through the steps to ensure you master this dish!</p>

<h2 id="goal">Level 9 Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cook Spaghetti to Perfection:</strong> The main goal of this level is to cook spaghetti correctly — al dente! Getting the pasta just right is important for customer satisfaction. Too soft or too hard will affect your score.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong> Spaghetti isn't just about the noodles. In Cookingdom, you'll need to prepare the right sauce to go with your pasta, whether it's a tomato sauce, cream-based sauce, or pesto. The sauce should be flavorful and paired well with the spaghetti.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve Quickly:</strong> As with other levels, speed and precision are key. Your customers are waiting, and serving a perfect plate of spaghetti at the right temperature is crucial for earning high ratings.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Steps to Make Spaghetti</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Boil the Water:</h3>
        <p>First, fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil. You'll need enough water to cook the spaghetti properly, so make sure the pot is large enough.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Adding salt to the water helps season the pasta and improves its texture.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Cook the Spaghetti:</h3>
        <p>Once the water is boiling, add the spaghetti noodles. Make sure the noodles are fully submerged in the water to cook evenly. In Cookingdom, the pasta will take around 7-10 minutes to cook, depending on your chosen doneness.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Stir the pasta occasionally to prevent it from sticking together. Keep an eye on the timer, as overcooked pasta will be soft and mushy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Prepare the Sauce:</h3>
        <p>While the pasta is cooking, it's time to prepare the sauce. Cookingdom offers different types of sauces, so make sure you are preparing the right one based on the customer's order. For a tomato sauce, sauté onions and garlic in olive oil, add canned tomatoes, and simmer. For a cream sauce, melt butter and cream, then season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Simmer the sauce for a few minutes to allow the flavors to develop. You can also add herbs like basil, oregano, or parsley to enhance the sauce's flavor.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Drain and Combine:</h3>
        <p>Once the pasta is cooked, drain it carefully, making sure to reserve a little pasta water (for adjusting the sauce if necessary). Add the pasta to the pan with the sauce, and toss it well to coat the noodles evenly.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to loosen it and make the sauce stick better.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Serve the Spaghetti:</h3>
        <p>Once the pasta and sauce are well combined, plate the spaghetti. Garnish with additional toppings like grated cheese, fresh herbs, or a drizzle of olive oil. In Cookingdom, some customers may ask for specific toppings, so be sure to check their orders carefully.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Serve the spaghetti as soon as it's ready to avoid overcooking or letting it cool down. Cookingdom customers expect hot, fresh food, so quick service is key.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips">Tips & Tricks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Perfect Timing:</strong> The most important aspect of cooking spaghetti is timing. If you cook the noodles for too long, they'll become mushy, and if they're undercooked, they'll be too tough. Cookingdom provides a timer for each dish, so pay attention and don't forget to check your pasta frequently.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sauce Preparation:</strong> Sauce is just as important as the pasta! Make sure your sauce is flavorful and well-seasoned. In Cookingdom, the customers will often request specific types of sauces or garnishes, so be sure to pay attention to their orders.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Upgrade Your Kitchen Tools:</strong> As you progress through Cookingdom, you can unlock new kitchen equipment that will make your pasta cooking faster and more efficient. Upgrading your stove or adding a larger pot can help you prepare multiple orders of spaghetti at once.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Handling Multiple Orders:</strong> In Cookingdom, you'll often have more than one order to manage at once. Prepare the spaghetti and sauce for each order simultaneously, and serve them as they are completed. Prioritize orders that have been waiting longer and check to ensure you're cooking the correct sauce for each customer.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Customer Satisfaction:</strong> Customers in Cookingdom are very particular about the quality and speed of their orders. To keep them happy, serve the spaghetti promptly and make sure it's cooked to their desired level. Overcooked pasta will disappoint them, and undercooked pasta will cause complaints.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In Level 9 of Cookingdom, preparing the perfect Spaghetti requires careful attention to detail. From boiling the pasta to preparing the sauce and serving it hot, timing and efficiency are key to earning high ratings. As you juggle multiple orders, make sure each plate of spaghetti is served to perfection with the right sauce and toppings.</p>
<p>By mastering this dish, you'll unlock more complex recipes and continue to grow your skills in Cookingdom. Perfect your pasta-cooking technique and continue advancing through the game to face new and exciting culinary challenges!</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Cookingdom Level 10 Steps to Make Salmon Sushi</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Cookingdom Level 10 Prepare the Sushi Rice:</h3>
        <p>The first step in making Salmon Sushi is preparing the sushi rice. Start by rinsing the rice thoroughly to remove excess starch. This helps prevent the rice from becoming too sticky.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Rinse the rice multiple times until the water runs clear to get the perfect texture.</p>
        <p>Cook the rice in a rice cooker or pot. Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large bowl and allow it to cool. After the rice cools slightly, season it with a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt to give it the signature flavor.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Stir the rice gently with a wooden spoon to avoid crushing the grains. Let it cool completely before using it for the sushi.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Cookingdom Level 10 Slice the Fresh Salmon:</h3>
        <p>While the rice cools, it's time to prepare the salmon. Cookingdom requires you to slice the salmon into thin, even slices. Use a sharp knife to achieve clean, smooth cuts. Each slice should be about 1/8-inch thick for the best sushi texture.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use fresh, high-quality salmon for the best taste. In Cookingdom, you'll be able to select the freshest ingredients available, so make sure to pick a top-quality piece of salmon.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Cookingdom Level 10 Assemble the Sushi:</h3>
        <p>Now, it's time to assemble the sushi. Lay a small amount of sushi rice on a bamboo mat or clean surface. Gently spread the rice to form a thin, even layer.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't press the rice too hard; just lightly spread it to ensure the sushi remains light and fluffy.</p>
        <p>Place a slice of fresh salmon on top of the rice, making sure it's centered and evenly spaced.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If Cookingdom offers you a choice of garnishes, such as wasabi or pickled ginger, don't forget to add these elements for an authentic experience.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Cookingdom Level 10 Roll the Sushi:</h3>
        <p>Use the bamboo mat to roll the rice and salmon together tightly. Make sure the roll is firm but not too tight, as this will help hold the sushi together without squashing the rice.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Roll the sushi slowly and carefully to ensure the rice and salmon stay in place.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Cookingdom Level 10 Slice and Serve the Sushi:</h3>
        <p>Once your sushi is rolled, slice it into bite-sized pieces. In Cookingdom, the cut should be clean and smooth, not jagged. A sharp knife is essential for making perfect sushi slices.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> For an authentic look, ensure each slice is uniform in size and shape.</p>
        <p>Serve Promptly:</p>
        <p>As with all dishes in Cookingdom, customers prefer their sushi fresh. Serve the sushi immediately after cutting it to ensure it's at its best.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips">Cookingdom Level 10 Tips & Tricks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Perfect Sushi Rice:</strong> Sushi rice is the foundation of great sushi, so make sure you get it just right. Follow the exact steps to rinse, cook, and season the rice. Cookingdom allows you to fine-tune your rice seasoning, so experiment until you get the perfect balance of vinegar, sugar, and salt.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Use a Sharp Knife for Slicing:</strong> The key to clean, even slices of salmon is a sharp knife. If the knife is dull, the salmon may get squashed or shredded instead of sliced cleanly.
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> In Cookingdom, you may be able to upgrade your knife as you progress, so consider improving your tools to ensure perfect sushi slices.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Don't Overfill the Sushi Roll:</strong> While it's tempting to load up on salmon, don't overfill the sushi roll. Too much filling can make it difficult to roll tightly and evenly. The ideal sushi roll has a balanced amount of rice and fish.
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep the filling centered and be gentle when rolling to maintain the sushi's shape.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Multitasking:</strong> As more orders come in, you may be asked to prepare other dishes alongside your sushi. In Cookingdom, multitasking is essential. While the rice is cooling, you can start preparing other ingredients or assembling other dishes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Garnishing and Presentation:</strong> Cookingdom rewards beautiful presentation. Add small garnishes like pickled ginger or wasabi to elevate your dish. Make sure the sushi is plated attractively to improve customer satisfaction and get higher ratings.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In Cookingdom Level 10 , preparing Salmon Sushi is a challenge that tests your precision, time management, and multitasking skills. From cooking the rice to slicing the fish and rolling the sushi, every step requires attention to detail. The key to success is freshness, accuracy, and quick service.</p>
<p>Mastering sushi will set you up for success in future levels, as customers will expect more complex and delicate dishes. With practice, you'll be able to create perfect sushi rolls that keep your customers happy and your restaurant thriving.</p>`,
